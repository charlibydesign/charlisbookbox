<p class="review__description"><b>The enchanting and bloodthirsty sequel to the New York Times bestselling novel The Cruel Prince.</b></p>
        
<p><i>You must be strong enough to strike and strike and strike again without tiring.The first lesson is to make yourself strong.</i></p>
        
 <p>After the jaw-dropping revelation that Oak is the heir to Faerie, Jude must keep her brother safe. To do so, she has bound the wicked king, Cardan, to her, and made herself the power behind the throne. Navigating the constantly shifting political alliances of Faerie would be difficult enough if Cardan were easy to control. But he does everything in his power to humiliate and undermine her even as his fascination with her remains undiminished.When it becomes all too clear that someone close to Jude means to betray her, threatening her own life and the lives of everyone she loves, Jude must uncover the traitor and fight her own complicated feelings for Cardan to maintain control as a mortal in a Faerie world.</p>
</section>

<p>Another great novel that takes place in Faerie. You can really get a feel for how things work in the land of Faerie. You get to see war, love, betrayal, and you even get twists and turns you may not anticipate.</p>

<p>This book could not have been a more perfect sequel to <i>The Cruel Prince</i>. Questions were answered, more questions were raised.</p>

<p>You got to see what makes Jude and Cardan tick. I’ll be honest, I’ve been shipping them since <i>The Cruel Prince</i>. Locke, well, I’d like to smack him because I don’t think he’s right for Taryn and he’s such a brat.</p>

<p>Then again, by the end of <i>The Wicked King</i>, I’d rather have beaten Taryn, Madoc, and Cardan than look at them.</p>

<p>Cardan made me wonder what the hell he was thinking/doing, but I suppose the next book will give me the answers I need. This was another 5 star read from Holly Black and I can’t wait for <i>The Queen of Nothing</i> to come out in January 2020. I’ve already pre-ordered my copy so I don’t have to wait for it at the library.</p>
