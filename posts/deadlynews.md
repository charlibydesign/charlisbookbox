<p class="review__description"><b>The new editor of a small-town newspaper gets a killer story in this cozy mystery series debut set on the Oregon coast.</b></p>

<p>Newspaper editor Molly Owens is eager to bring the struggling Britton Bay Bulletin up to speed. But pushing one of her reporters to dig deeper into a story seems to backfire when he winds up murdered. And since the middling journalist had a talent for making enemies, finding his killer won’t be easy. The lists of suspects includes his ex-wife, his own son, and even Molly’s boss. As Molly searches for answers, she finds herself targeted by mysterious threats—and the trouble is only beginning. The one bright spot is Molly’s newfound flirtation with Sam Alderich. The sexy mechanic is used to taking things apart and piecing them back together, and between the two of them they just might be able to solve this deadly puzzle—if Molly can survive peaceful small-town life long enough . . .  </p>

<p><b>“Deadly News will make you want to pack up and move to the seaside town of Britton Bay, Oregon. The characters are vividly brought to life, there’s a perfect touch of romance, and the mystery has enough twists and turns to keep the reader guessing.”—Sarah Fox, USA Today bestselling author</b></p>

<blockquote>I received this book for free from NetGalley in exchange for an honest review. This does not affect my opinion of the book or the content of my review.</blockquote>

<p>Cozy mysteries are a relatively new found love of mine. <i>Deadly News</i> by Jody Holford fits the bill perfectly.</p>

<p>A murder in a sleepy Oregon town and a complete mystery, with twists that aren’t telegraphed six chapters before they happen, are what you’ll find with this book. Quaint touches, such as referring to a Coke or Pepsi as a cola, are found throughout the book.</p>

<p>The hint of danger that pervades the book and the sleepy little town, despite it being your typical small town, keep you on you toes and the edge of your seat. The budding romance between Molly and Sam – which was telegraphed immediately – is sweet but not overly sweet. The book is also not steamy, which is nice as well.</p>

<p>The book is quite well written and can be read in a single night if the reader is of a mind to do so. It’s a fast paced book and will have you wanting to keep reading more. I that my Kindle App said it was about 3.5 hours to read the whole book, although that’s at my reading speed. Your results may vary.</p>

<p>I gave this one 5 out of 5 stars. I definitely recommend this book for cozy mystery lovers or anyone looking to get started in the cozy mystery genre.</p>
