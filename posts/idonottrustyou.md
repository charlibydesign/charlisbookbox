<p class="review__description">With Laura J. Burns and Melinda Metz's signature plot twists, and uneasy, ever-changing alliances,<i>I Do Not Trust You</i> is a thrilling journey at every turn that asks—what would you do to save the ones you love?</p>
        
<p>Memphis "M" Engel is stubborn to a fault, graced with an almost absurd knowledge of long lost languages and cultures, and a heck of an opponent in a fight. In short: she's awesome.</p>
        
 <p>Ashwin “Ash” Sood is a little too posh for M's tastes, a little too good looking, and has way too many secrets. He desperately wants the ancient map M inherited from her archeologist father, believing it will lead him to a relic with the power to destroy the world. M obviously can't trust him.</p>

 <p>Equally desperate to find the relic for reasons of her own, M forms an uneasy partnership with Ash. From the catacombs of Paris, to a sacred forest in Norway, to the ruins of a submerged temple in Egypt, together they crisscross the globe in their search. But through it all, M can never be sure: Is she traveling with a friend or enemy?</p>

<p>When I was asked to review <i>I Do Not Trust You</i>, I was a bit on the skeptical side. I’ve been having some issues with books that have multiple authors lately – for some reason I just can’t seem to get into them or if I do get into them, I can’t seem to stay interested in them. But this one? This one was awesome!</p>

<p>Laura J. Burns &amp; Melinda Metz have teamed up before – in fact, one of their previous novels, <i>Sanctuary Bay</i>, is in my TBR pile at this very moment, and might very well be my next read.  That alone should have told me that this book would be a winner – because author teams generally don’t end up writing more books together unless the previous ones are great.</p>

<p>I love the characters – Memphis (M) and Ashwin (Ash) at least. I’m rather fond of Mike as well and let me tell you, I was as surprised as Ash was when we finally got to meet Mike in person. I definitely wasn’t expecting that! The other characters, such as Phillip, Bob, and Liza definitely aren’t my favorites but then again, they’re not meant to be the readers’ favorite characters. They’re obnoxious and downright evil in some cases.</p>

<p>I loved the use of the Egyptian mythology as honestly, I love Egyptian mythology – the book actually made me want to brush up on it because it’s been a while since I’ve been able to read up on any of it. I Do Not Trust You is action packed even if it doesn’t seem like it would be – believe me, it is.  It’s difficult to put down once you start reading and frankly, I had to force myself to put it down to do things like eat, sleep, and housework. As for the ending – you will be so amazed!!</p>

<p>This book was so well written and so well edited that I have to give it 5 stars. It’s a great book – funny at times, heart-pounding at times, and just absolutely awesome. You won’t regret reading this one.</p>
