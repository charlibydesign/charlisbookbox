<p class="review__description">Don’t miss <i>Shadowhunters: The Mortal Instruments</i>, soon to be an Freeform original series. Discover the world it was based on in the first installment of the internationally bestselling Mortal Instruments series and “prepare to be hooked” (<i>Entertainment Weekly</i>).</p>

<p>Enter the world of the Shadowhunters in this special edition of the New York Times bestselling <i>City of Bones</i>, complete with gorgeous cover art from the upcoming Freeform Original Series, <i>Shadowhunters</i>.</p>

<p>When Clary Fray heads out to the Pandemonium Club in New York City, she hardly expects to witness a murder—much less a murder committed by three teenagers covered with strange tattoos and brandishing bizarre weapons. And she’s more than a little startled when the body disappears into thin air. Soon Clary is introduced to the world of the Shadowhunters, a secret cadre of warriors dedicated to driving demons out of our world and back to their own. And Clary is introduced with a vengeance, when her mother disappears and Clary herself is almost killed by a grotesque monster. How could a mere human survive such an attack and kill a demon? The Shadowhunters would like to know…</p>

<p>I’ve been dying to get my hands on this series for a LONG time, so when I saw all five were available at my local library, I pounced. I read City of Bones in 2 days, which is pretty fast for me with a book that is 485 pages.</p>

<p>This book was definitely worth the hype I’d seen for it. It’s amazing! And the Shadowhunters TV series? Doesn’t do the book justice. In fact, I didn’t like the TV series (I know, blasphemy) so I was sincerely hoping the books would be far better. I wasn’t disappointed.</p>

<p>I love Clary & Jace… not fond of Isabelle or Alec. I’d like to take Valentine out and just… well… get rid of him because he’s such a royal pain as a bad guy. But then again, if I didn’t want to get rid of him, he wouldn’t be a very good bad guy now would he? Simon’s a pretty cool character as well. I love how he feels about Clary although sometimes the way he treats her just sucks.</p>

<p>I can’t wait to delve into the other books – I just hope I can read them all before I have to take them back!</p>
