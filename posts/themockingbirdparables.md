<p class="review__description"><i>The Mockingbird Parables</i> takes readers on an inspiring and engaging journey through Harper Lee’s beloved 1960 literary masterpiece, introducing each character through the lens of faith. The enigmatic Boo Radley as an allegorical representation of God, “the divine, mysterious neighbor” who watches over, protects, and longs to know his children personally. The hero, Atticus Finch, as a model of faith, integrity, and even parenting. The main character, Scout Finch, and what she might teach us about the role of women in church and society. The Mockingbird Parables compels us to ask the often-ignored questions: Do we truly love our neighbors? Are we building community? Are we influencing society for the better? By illuminating the parallels between Christian faith and Lee’s masterpiece, <i>The Mockingbird Parables</i> reaffirms the magnitude of a novel perhaps more relevant today than ever before.</p>

<blockquote>I received this book for free from Tyndale House in exchange for an honest review. This does not affect my opinion of the book or the content of my review.</blockquote>

<p>When I originally picked this book up, I thought it would be fairly straightforward. I knew it was based in “To Kill a Mockingbird” by Harper Lee, but I wasn’t expecting to need to read that book before being able to use/work with this book.</p>

<p>Sadly, this book requires a working knowledge of/familiarity with “To Kill a Mockingbird” or else you won’t understand what is going on. Unfortunately, as that book was never on any required reading lists I had in school, I’ve never read it and so was completely lost when attempting to go through this book.</p>

<p>If you haven’t read “To Kill a Mockingbird” don’t bother to pick this book up until you have because you’ll be completely lost.</p>
