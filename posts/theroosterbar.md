<p class="review__description"><b>#1 New York Times bestselling author John Grisham’s newest legal thriller takes you inside a law firm that’s on shaky ground.“[A] buoyant, mischievous thriller . . . Grisham writes in such an inventive spirit. . . . A treat.”—Janet Maslin, The New York Times</b></p>
        
<p>Mark, Todd, and Zola came to law school to change the world, to make it a better place. But now, as third-year students, these close friends realize they have been duped. They all borrowed heavily to attend a third-tier for-profit law school so mediocre that its graduates rarely pass the bar exam, let alone get good jobs. And when they learn that their school is one of a chain owned by a shady New York hedge-fund operator who also happens to own a bank specializing in student loans, the three know they have been caught up in The Great Law School Scam.   But maybe there’s a way out. Maybe there’s a way to escape their crushing debt, expose the bank and the scam, and make a few bucks in the process. But to do so, they would first have to quit school. And leaving law school a few short months before graduation would be completely crazy, right? Well, yes and no . . .   Pull up a stool, grab a cold one, and get ready to spend some time at The Rooster Bar. </p>
        
 <p><b>“Satisfying . . . Grisham [is] at his best when he brings his sardonic sense of humor to the sometimes questionable ethics of law and banking.”—USA Today   “[A] smartly told tale . . . gratifying and all-too-real.”—The Washington Post</b></p>

<p>I’ll be honest, I haven’t read a John Grisham novel in years. I was really into his novels when I was in high school, but to be honest, after high school I kind of lost interest. I think the last time I’d read one of his novels was back in the early 2000s when I still lived in Texas.</p>

<p>The book was all right, but it wasn’t the type of story I’m used to from John Grisham. I’m used to his books being more like The Pelican Brief and A Time to Kill. This one wasn’t so much like that and I guess I was just expecting another lawyer making a name for him/herself because he/she took on a case that was making big headlines.</p>

<p>The book was well written, although you might have to get a notepad to keep track of changing names and what’s going on with each person’s family because it can get a bit on the complicated side. I don’t think this book had quite as much character development as previous novels and to be honest, I think that was part of why I didn’t like it. It just didn’t have that John Grisham feel.</p>

<p>All in all, it was a good book but not one I’d really recommend to long time fans of John Grisham.</p>
