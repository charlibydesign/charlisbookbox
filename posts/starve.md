<p class="review__description">Once the world's most famous chef, Gavin Cruikshank's been in a self-imposed exile for years. His little foodie television program has since evolved into STARVE, an arena sport that pits chef against chef for the pleasure of their super-rich patrons. It's a stain on a once-noble profession, and Chef Gavin is ready to go to war to stop it. Two things stand in his way: his arch rival Roman Algiers, and his adult daughter Angie, who probably just wants her dad back and acting normal.</p>

<p>Starve was, in a word, amazing. I was absolutely captivated, only breaking when I need to blink my eyes away from my screen for a few seconds. I didn’t want it to end and was sad when it did.</p>

<p>What intrigued me was the fact that the graphic novel was based around a cooking show. Around a celebrity chef who’d disappeared for years on the other side of the world and suddenly is brought back to compete on the show he created. It’s so hard to describe how I feel about this graphic novel. I’m sincerely hoping I can have a chance to read and review Volume 2 because the way this ended, there has to be a Volume 2 or I might just cry!</p>
