<p class="review__description">Is love worth betraying everything? Plunge into the second adventure in the internationally bestselling Mortal Instruments series and “prepare to be hooked” (<i>Entertainment Weekly</i>)..</p>

<p>Clary Fray just wishes that her life would go back to normal. But what's normal when you're a demon-slaying Shadowhunter, your mother is in a magically induced coma, and you can suddenly see Downworlders like werewolves, vampires, and faeries? If Clary left the world of the Shadowhunters behind, it would mean more time with her best friend, Simon, who's becoming more than a friend. But the Shadowhunting world isn't ready to let her go -- especially her handsome, infuriating, newfound brother, Jace. And Clary's only chance to help her mother is to track down rogue Shadowhunter Valentine, who is probably insane, certainly evil—and also her father.</p>

<p>To complicate matters, someone in New York City is murdering Downworlder children. Is Valentine behind the killings—and if he is, what is he trying to do? When the second of the Mortal Instruments, the Soul-Sword, is stolen, the terrifying Inquisitor arrives to investigate and zooms right in on Jace. How can Clary stop Valentine if Jace is willing to betray everything he believes in to help their father?</p>

<p>In this breathtaking sequel to <i>City of Bones</i>, Cassandra Clare lures her readers back into the dark grip of New York City's Downworld, where love is never safe and power becomes the deadliest temptation.</p>

<p>The sequel to <i>City of Bones, City of Ashes</i> is no less addicting and action packed than it’s predecessor. Just like <i>City of Bones</i>, I didn’t want to put the book down. Lately, that seems like a near impossibility for me.</p>

<p>I realized after perusing the library’s website that there are actually six books in The Mortal Instruments series as opposed to five. For some reason I managed to miss the fact that a sixth book came out entirely. That just makes me even happier because I don’t want this story to end!</p>

<p>I’ve come to absolutely adore Jace and Clary but I’m still not sure if I really like Isabelle all that much. Alec is growing on me and while I know part of his story because of all the Tumblr posts about the Shadowhunters TV series, I can’t wait to see how it plays out in the books. Luke is another favorite character. And while I hated The Inquisitor, I was sad to see how her portion of the story ended.</p>

<p>I can’t wait for the third book to become available again – I had to turn in books 3-5 because they were due and had holds on them. I’ve got holds on all four of the remaining books and I can’t wait to get my hands on them!</p>
