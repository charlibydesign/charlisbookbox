<p class="review__description"><b>Now in mass market paperback, discover a high stakes world with unexpected and sinister twists that's "visual, kinetic, and furiously paced" from Marie Lu, #1 New York Times bestselling author of the Legend series</b></p>
        
<p>For the millions who log in every day, Warcross isn't just a game--it's a way of life. Struggling to make ends meet, teenage hacker Emika Chen works as a bounty hunter, tracking down players who bet on the game illegally. Needing to make some quick cash, Emika takes a risk and hacks into the opening game of the international Warcross Championships--only to accidentally glitch herself into the action and become an overnight sensation. Convinced she's going to be arrested, Emika is shocked when instead she gets a call from the game's creator, the elusive young billionaire Hideo Tanaka, with an irresistible offer. With no time to lose, Emika's whisked off to Tokyo and thrust into a world of fame and fortune that she's only dreamed of. But soon her investigation uncovers a sinister plot, with major consequences for the entire Warcross empire.</p>

<p>I’d been wanting to read Warcross by Marie Lu since I’d heard it was coming out. I’d tried for it on NetGalley but was turned down – probably due to my seriously ridiculous backlog there. So when I finally found it here in the library, I snapped it up.</p>

<p>The book was well hyped before it came out and so many readers had said it was so good that I expected my mind to be blown. Instead, while it was most definitely good enough to earn it a 4 star review, it wasn’t the mind-blowing experience I’d expected from the hype. In fact, I found it all to easy to put the book down and not pick it up.</p>

<p>The game of Warcross just wasn’t interesting to me, and I found myself putting the book down for a bit whenever a game was described. I was much more interested in figuring out who Zero was – and unfortunately, it wasn’t too difficult to figure it out. Honestly, I’d have waited until Wildcard, the second book in the series to actually reveal who Zero is… even if it was just in the beginning of the new book.</p>

<p>That being said, the book was very well written and I am looking forward to Wildcard being released. I’m hoping to be able to read a copy as soon as the library gets it because the story is an addicting one outside the descriptions of the Warcross games.</p>
