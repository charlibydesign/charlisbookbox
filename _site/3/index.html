<p class="review__description">A collection of short fiction from Terry Pratchett, spanning the whole of his writing career from schooldays to Discworld and the present day. In the four decades since his first book appeared in print, Terry Pratchett has become one of the world's best-selling and best-loved authors. Here for the first time are his short stories and other short-form fiction collected into one volume. <i>A Blink of the Screen</i> charts the course of Pratchett's long writing career: from his schooldays through to his first writing job on the Bucks Free Press, and the origins of his debut novel, <i>The Carpet People</i>; and on again to the dizzy mastery of the phenomenally successful Discworld series. Here are characters both familiar and yet to be discovered; abandoned worlds and others still expanding; adventure, chickens, death, disco and, actually, some quite disturbing ideas about Christmas, all of it shot through with Terry's inimitable brand of humour. With an introduction by Booker Prize-winning author A.S. Byatt, illustrations by the late Josh Kirby and drawings by the author himself, this is a book to treasure.</p>
</section>
<p>This was my first foray into reading Terry Pratchett and I have to say, although the stories were good, they weren’t GREAT.</p>
<p>Part of this is due to some of the stories having been written a long time ago, when he’d first started writing. Part of this is also due to my not being particularly knowledgeable about Discworld, and so the Discworld stories didn’t really make any sense to me.</p>
<p>Terry Pratchett’s writing style is very good. He knows how to tell a story. I’m not denying that. He knows how to develop characters in just a few short sentences so that a short story can get on with it. But some of the earlier works – I’m just not sure why the editors and publisher were willing to have them in there… and Terry himself was rather embarrassed by some of the stories.</p>
<p>All in all, it was a good introduction to Terry Pratchett and I would recommend it to those who haven’t read his works as a way to introduce themselves to his writing style. Just keep in mind that some of the stories are from way back when and could use a little work.</p></article></li>

<p class="review__description"><b>Wherever you are, let Jesus be your all.</b>  Written by popular author and blogger Sophie Hudson, this beautiful devotional journal for teens and young women reminds you that Jesus is your All in All—over all, through all, and in all that you do.   As you dig in to Sophie's words and wit, you'll better understand the wholeness and freedom that come from a life filled with Jesus. Each of the 100 devotions is followed by journaling prompts that will get you writing, keep you thinking, and help you grab all the goodness He has waiting for you.</p>

<p>When I chose to review this journaling devotional, I did so because I thought it was unique. I have several devotionals laying around the house, but none of them are particularly “interactive” where you would actually answer questions, write out your thoughts or feelings, or even really think about possibly praying about what you’d read. They’re just little blurbs by this or that author – some of them are about strong women of faith, others are different “insights” about Christ’s love for us and our walk with Christ. But none of them had the journaling aspect to them.</p>
<p>I wasn’t disappointed. “All in All” is a 100 day devotional geared toward teen girls. It features a devotional, scripture readings, and a place to answer questions, write out your thoughts and feelings, and even a place each day to write out the day’s prayers. If you want to be able to use the devotional for multiple girls, I’d suggest giving each girl who will be using it a notebook or journal to write in instead of writing in the book – or buying one for each girl.
</p>
<p>One of my favorite sections was on Martha and Mary from the New Testament. We all know the story of how Martha got fed up with Mary not helping her with the work that needed to be done while Jesus was visiting and basically asked Him to tell Mary to get up and help her. Then after Lazarus died, when Jesus arrived, she argued with him about various things. In all honesty, I see a lot of Martha in me. I can guarantee you that I wouldn’t shut up and listen, I’d be arguing because I overthink everything.</p>
<p>I would definitely recommend this book for anyone looking for a good devotional for a teen girl. I agree with some of the responses on Goodreads – I’d like to see a version for women as well.</p></article></li>

<p class="review__description"><i>The Mockingbird Parables</i> takes readers on an inspiring and engaging journey through Harper Lee’s beloved 1960 literary masterpiece, introducing each character through the lens of faith. The enigmatic Boo Radley as an allegorical representation of God, “the divine, mysterious neighbor” who watches over, protects, and longs to know his children personally. The hero, Atticus Finch, as a model of faith, integrity, and even parenting. The main character, Scout Finch, and what she might teach us about the role of women in church and society. The Mockingbird Parables compels us to ask the often-ignored questions: Do we truly love our neighbors? Are we building community? Are we influencing society for the better? By illuminating the parallels between Christian faith and Lee’s masterpiece, <i>The Mockingbird Parables</i> reaffirms the magnitude of a novel perhaps more relevant today than ever before.</p>

<blockquote>I received this book for free from Tyndale House in exchange for an honest review. This does not affect my opinion of the book or the content of my review.</blockquote>
<p>When I originally picked this book up, I thought it would be fairly straightforward. I knew it was based in “To Kill a Mockingbird” by Harper Lee, but I wasn’t expecting to need to read that book before being able to use/work with this book.</p>
<p>Sadly, this book requires a working knowledge of/familiarity with “To Kill a Mockingbird” or else you won’t understand what is going on. Unfortunately, as that book was never on any required reading lists I had in school, I’ve never read it and so was completely lost when attempting to go through this book.</p>
<p>If you haven’t read “To Kill a Mockingbird” don’t bother to pick this book up until you have because you’ll be completely lost.</p></article></li>

<p class="review__description"><b>American sports icon Tim Tebow shares how he faces pressure head-on and the wisdom he’s learned—not from what the world says, but from what God says in His Word The world does not define you.</b></p>
<p>Nobody said your life would be easy. And the older you get, the more difficult it seems to become.

Your identity resides in something—in fact, Someone—much greater than anything this world can offer: <b>the only identity worth having . . . is found in Jesus Christ!</b> Tim Tebow will guide you through thirty-six weeks of lessons, each based on a key Scripture, to discover who you are—by learning more about whose you are! You’ll have the opportunity to write down your thoughts, feelings, and ideas on topics such as:• Building godly character• Maintaining great relationships• Standing out from the crowd• Doing things that matter in the big picture Get ready to live bigger than ever before . . . with your faith and identity secure in a God who loves you beyond measure!</p>

<blockquote>I received this book for free from Waterbrook Multnomah in exchange for an honest review. This does not affect my opinion of the book or the content of my review.</blockquote>
<p>If anyone thinks this book is *just* for home schooled children, they’d be wrong. This book is actually good for any teen, and even good for some adults to be honest. The fact the Tim Tebow was home schooled is most likely the reason behind him determining the book would be for home schooled kids.</p>
<p>This book gives 36 helpful weekly lessons on figuring out who you are and how following the Lord can make your life better. Each lesson comes with a writing exercise to encourage the reader to think about the lesson that was provided. While I read the book in 2 days because I wasn’t following the lesson plan, I would be more than willing to go back through the book and do the writing exercises.</p>
<p>36 weeks is equal to approximately one school year, so parents can use this book during their curriculum if they home school or just as a weekly study for their kids in general. I think this book is an excellent tool for helping kids find their faith and figure out who they are in Christ.</p>
<p>I also think that new Christians might benefit from this book, even though it is geared towards teens. It can be hard to figure out who you are in Christ at any age, especially if you’ve grown up in a family where faith is not a big part of your life.</p>
<p>Tim gives good, solid accounts of when he was a child/teen and how situations were handled. He admits he made and makes mistakes, something that it is good for anyone to see – that nobody is perfect.</p>
<p>This was a solid 4 star read and I have to say, I’ll probably be going back through the book and doing the writing exercises for myself.</p></article></li>

<p class="review__description">You will be inspired, challenged and encouraged to arise and journey with the Lord as women of the Bible did!</p>
<p>Join Jumoke Akinniranye in exploring the incredible, inspiring lives of many of the women in the Bible. In a time when women are searching for their true identity in God, this book will give you a good insight and understanding of the strength, gifting and weaknesses of these extraordinary women, allowing you to grasp the truth that they were ordinary woman, just like you, who chose to walk in the fullness of God's purpose for their lives.</p>
<p>This book will give you the confidence and assurance you need to boldly journey with the Lord as these women did - despite the challenges they had to confront and overcome. It will also show you how each of them was able to anchor their abilities and gifts to the Lord.</p>
<p>I believe that through this book you will receive a greater revelation of the Father's heart for women, which will help you in your journey with the Lord as you read it.</p>
<p>JUMOKE AKINNIRANYE is an accountant by profession. She was born in the UK and raised in Nigeria, the third child of Christian parents. She had a major encounter with the Lord in April 2009, spanning a continuous nine months, during which she received an unprecedented presence of God and was called into the offices of Apostle and Prophet. Jumoke resides in Hertfordshire, England with her two sons Ore and Seun.</p>

<p>While I was drawn in by the title of this book, I honestly thought I would end up not liking it. After all, I usually get annoyed with non-fiction Christian books for some reason. There always seems to be something that just bugs me about them. Not so much for this one.</p>
<p>Jumoke Akinniranye paints a fuller picture of some of the most prominent women of the Bible, giving insight as to how they might have felt, what the culture of the time was like and how they fit into that culture, and showing what we can learn from them. She even includes women who set bad examples, such as Queen Jezebel – so we can learn from their mistakes.</p>
<p>One of my favorite sections was on Martha and Mary from the New Testament. We all know the story of how Martha got fed up with Mary not helping her with the work that needed to be done while Jesus was visiting and basically asked Him to tell Mary to get up and help her. Then after Lazarus died, when Jesus arrived, she argued with him about various things. In all honesty, I see a lot of Martha in me. I can guarantee you that I wouldn’t shut up and listen, I’d be arguing because I overthink everything.</p>
<p>I must say there was one spot that I was a bit flustered with – the story of Sarah/Sarai. In this section, the author states that nothing is known of Sarah’s lineage, but that’s not actually true. In Genesis 20:12, when Abraham is answering to Abimelek as to why they lied about Sarah being his sister instead of his wife, Abraham answers that she really is his sister – the daughter of his father though not of his mother, who happened to become his wife. So we know that Abraham and Sarah share a father. But this is just something minor in comparison to the lessons this book as for women of faith.</p>
<p>I definitely recommend this book to any woman looking to grow her faith and see how God could use her to serve Him.</p></article></li>
