<p class="review__description"><b>Wherever you are, let Jesus be your all.</b>  Written by popular author and blogger Sophie Hudson, this beautiful devotional journal for teens and young women reminds you that Jesus is your All in All—over all, through all, and in all that you do.   As you dig in to Sophie's words and wit, you'll better understand the wholeness and freedom that come from a life filled with Jesus. Each of the 100 devotions is followed by journaling prompts that will get you writing, keep you thinking, and help you grab all the goodness He has waiting for you.</p>

<p>When I chose to review this journaling devotional, I did so because I thought it was unique. I have several devotionals laying around the house, but none of them are particularly “interactive” where you would actually answer questions, write out your thoughts or feelings, or even really think about possibly praying about what you’d read. They’re just little blurbs by this or that author – some of them are about strong women of faith, others are different “insights” about Christ’s love for us and our walk with Christ. But none of them had the journaling aspect to them.</p>
<p>I wasn’t disappointed. “All in All” is a 100 day devotional geared toward teen girls. It features a devotional, scripture readings, and a place to answer questions, write out your thoughts and feelings, and even a place each day to write out the day’s prayers. If you want to be able to use the devotional for multiple girls, I’d suggest giving each girl who will be using it a notebook or journal to write in instead of writing in the book – or buying one for each girl.
</p>
<p>One of my favorite sections was on Martha and Mary from the New Testament. We all know the story of how Martha got fed up with Mary not helping her with the work that needed to be done while Jesus was visiting and basically asked Him to tell Mary to get up and help her. Then after Lazarus died, when Jesus arrived, she argued with him about various things. In all honesty, I see a lot of Martha in me. I can guarantee you that I wouldn’t shut up and listen, I’d be arguing because I overthink everything.</p>
<p>I would definitely recommend this book for anyone looking for a good devotional for a teen girl. I agree with some of the responses on Goodreads – I’d like to see a version for women as well.</p></article></li>

<p class="review__description"><i>The Mockingbird Parables</i> takes readers on an inspiring and engaging journey through Harper Lee’s beloved 1960 literary masterpiece, introducing each character through the lens of faith. The enigmatic Boo Radley as an allegorical representation of God, “the divine, mysterious neighbor” who watches over, protects, and longs to know his children personally. The hero, Atticus Finch, as a model of faith, integrity, and even parenting. The main character, Scout Finch, and what she might teach us about the role of women in church and society. The Mockingbird Parables compels us to ask the often-ignored questions: Do we truly love our neighbors? Are we building community? Are we influencing society for the better? By illuminating the parallels between Christian faith and Lee’s masterpiece, <i>The Mockingbird Parables</i> reaffirms the magnitude of a novel perhaps more relevant today than ever before.</p>

<p>When I originally picked this book up, I thought it would be fairly straightforward. I knew it was based in “To Kill a Mockingbird” by Harper Lee, but I wasn’t expecting to need to read that book before being able to use/work with this book.</p>
<p>Sadly, this book requires a working knowledge of/familiarity with “To Kill a Mockingbird” or else you won’t understand what is going on. Unfortunately, as that book was never on any required reading lists I had in school, I’ve never read it and so was completely lost when attempting to go through this book.</p>
<p>If you haven’t read “To Kill a Mockingbird” don’t bother to pick this book up until you have because you’ll be completely lost.</p></article></li>

<p>If anyone thinks this book is *just* for home schooled children, they’d be wrong. This book is actually good for any teen, and even good for some adults to be honest. The fact the Tim Tebow was home schooled is most likely the reason behind him determining the book would be for home schooled kids.</p>
<p>This book gives 36 helpful weekly lessons on figuring out who you are and how following the Lord can make your life better. Each lesson comes with a writing exercise to encourage the reader to think about the lesson that was provided. While I read the book in 2 days because I wasn’t following the lesson plan, I would be more than willing to go back through the book and do the writing exercises.</p>
<p>36 weeks is equal to approximately one school year, so parents can use this book during their curriculum if they home school or just as a weekly study for their kids in general. I think this book is an excellent tool for helping kids find their faith and figure out who they are in Christ.</p>
<p>I also think that new Christians might benefit from this book, even though it is geared towards teens. It can be hard to figure out who you are in Christ at any age, especially if you’ve grown up in a family where faith is not a big part of your life.</p>
<p>Tim gives good, solid accounts of when he was a child/teen and how situations were handled. He admits he made and makes mistakes, something that it is good for anyone to see – that nobody is perfect.</p>
<p>This was a solid 4 star read and I have to say, I’ll probably be going back through the book and doing the writing exercises for myself.</p></article></li>
