<p class="review__description"><b>The enchanting and bloodthirsty sequel to the New York Times bestselling novel The Cruel Prince.</b></p>
<p><i>You must be strong enough to strike and strike and strike again without tiring.The first lesson is to make yourself strong.</i></p>
 <p>After the jaw-dropping revelation that Oak is the heir to Faerie, Jude must keep her brother safe. To do so, she has bound the wicked king, Cardan, to her, and made herself the power behind the throne. Navigating the constantly shifting political alliances of Faerie would be difficult enough if Cardan were easy to control. But he does everything in his power to humiliate and undermine her even as his fascination with her remains undiminished.When it becomes all too clear that someone close to Jude means to betray her, threatening her own life and the lives of everyone she loves, Jude must uncover the traitor and fight her own complicated feelings for Cardan to maintain control as a mortal in a Faerie world.</p>
</section>
<p>Another great novel that takes place in Faerie. You can really get a feel for how things work in the land of Faerie. You get to see war, love, betrayal, and you even get twists and turns you may not anticipate.</p>
<p>This book could not have been a more perfect sequel to <i>The Cruel Prince</i>. Questions were answered, more questions were raised.</p>
<p>You got to see what makes Jude and Cardan tick. I’ll be honest, I’ve been shipping them since <i>The Cruel Prince</i>. Locke, well, I’d like to smack him because I don’t think he’s right for Taryn and he’s such a brat.</p>
<p>Then again, by the end of <i>The Wicked King</i>, I’d rather have beaten Taryn, Madoc, and Cardan than look at them.</p>
<p>Cardan made me wonder what the hell he was thinking/doing, but I suppose the next book will give me the answers I need. This was another 5 star read from Holly Black and I can’t wait for <i>The Queen of Nothing</i> to come out in January 2020. I’ve already pre-ordered my copy so I don’t have to wait for it at the library.</p>

<p class="review__description"><b>By #1 New York Times bestselling author Holly Black, the first book in a stunning new series about a mortal girl who finds herself caught in a web of royal faerie intrigue.</b></p>
<p>Of course I want to be like them. They're beautiful as blades forged in some divine fire. They will live forever.</p>
 <p>And Cardan is even more beautiful than the rest. I hate him more than all the others. I hate him so much that sometimes when I look at him, I can hardly breathe.</p>
 <p>Jude was seven years old when her parents were murdered and she and her two sisters were stolen away to live in the treacherous High Court of Faerie. Ten years later, Jude wants nothing more than to belong there, despite her mortality. But many of the fey despise humans. Especially Prince Cardan, the youngest and wickedest son of the High King.</p>
 <p>To win a place at the Court, she must defy him--and face the consequences.</p>
 <p>In doing so, she becomes embroiled in palace intrigues and deceptions, discovering her own capacity for bloodshed. But as civil war threatens to drown the Courts of Faerie in violence, Jude will need to risk her life in a dangerous alliance to save her sisters, and Faerie itself.</p>
</section>
<p>Stories about Faerie fascinate me. The many different takes that never fail to include one common thread – Faerie is cruel, violent, & just plain a place no one should want to go.</p>
<p><i>The Cruel Prince</i> is everything Faerie is made out to be, but with one twist – mortals, humans, can play the games as well if they’re smart about it.</p>
<p>Jude is the one who doesn’t fit in, kind of wants to, but at the same time wants to fit in on her terms. She wants to be one of them, but not? Jude wants to fit in by being a member of the Court as someone’s knight.</p>
<p>Taryn just wants to fit in. She just wants to be one of them, but not in the same way her twin sister Jude does. Taryn wants to fall in love and become the wife of one of the Gentry and fit in that way.</p>
<p>Vivienne is half-fey, half-human. She’s the reason Jude and Taryn ended up growing up in Faerie in the first place. She would honestly rather live in the mortal world.</p>
<p>Cardan is an ass, but he’s a loveable ass in a way. You realize that his hatred for Jude isn’t what it appears to be.</p>
<p>This was one of the best representations of Faerie I’ve read and the best recent novel dealing with Faerie. I didn’t want to put it down. It has such a unique perspective. You don’t usually get Faerie novels from a mortal’s point of view.</p>
<p>Extremely well written, this book needs to be read by anyone who has a love of Faerie. I gave this one 5 stars because it is just excellent.</p></article></li>

<p class="review__description">"Sobey, a resident of rural Alaska, portrays Crystal's (a teenager) world with an insider's perspective, vividly depicting the environment and traditions." -KIRKUS REVIEWS</p>
<p>Crystal Rose, a 17-year-old high school junior, and her younger brother were abandoned by their drug-addicted mother fifteen years ago in an Alaskan Native village, an event which Crystal resented for years. However, when she learns that her mother was raped in high school, Crystal declares war against a society which reduces girls to their looks, forcing them to feel worthless without the approval of guys.</p>
<p>While living in a small Alaskan town, she starts The War Blog website, along with her best friend and crush Kato--a brilliant Native boy--attacking everything promoting female objectification and offering ways to fight back, all supplemented by her original songs. Crystal rises from nothing in the wilds of Alaska to become a champion for change, risking her life against men who would force her to keep silent. She faces her parents' abusive past and fights for a better world.</p>

<p>If there is one thing I can’t stand, it is a social justice warrior. Most of the ones I’ve run across never go farther than retweeting, reblogging, sharing and arguing with people who don’t share their world view, all while using hashtags like #staywoke or #justicefor(insert name here). I can’t stand them because they don’t get away from the keyboard and screen to do anything to affect change. But the social justice warriors in <i>The War Blog</i> by Glen Sobey aren’t like that.</p>
<p>Kato doesn’t just blog about Native problems in Alaska, he speaks to classes about them. He tries to make his people see that they need to make changes.</p>
<p>Crystal also makes it a point to affect change. Yes she has her blog and her songs. But she also comes up with ways to help make changes. She tells the stories that need to be told and tries to find ways to make the changes necessary. She suggests actual changes, in person, to the people instead of just blogging, reblogging, tweeting, etc..</p>
<p>The War Blog is an anti-rape culture and feminist blog. To be honest, rape culture is directly related to how men view women as less than equals. Crystal’s blog speaks out against rape culture. She speaks out against keeping silent, against letting the men who commit rape and abuse toward women get away with it.</p>
<p>The book is full of surprising twists that almost overshadow the social justice issues that Kato and Crystal’s blogs are meant to talk about. Even more surprising is that the book was written by a man. You just wouldn’t think that a male author would think of these things, being that the blame for rape culture is almost exclusively placed on men. Perhaps this was the author’s way of saying “Hey we aren’t all like that.”</p>
<p>You will grow to love most of the characters. You will want to hug Crystal, JD, Kato, etc.. You will want to punch Eugene/Steve, Dylan, etc..</p>
<p>This book gets 4 out of 5 stars. I loved the book, but a couple of “bit part” characters had story lines that were left hanging. I’d also love to see a sequel to this book, just to see how things are going in the future.</p></article></li>

<p class="review__description">Bullied at school and ignored at home, Travis has a secret: cutting himself with a razor blade is the only thing that lets him control the pain in his life and find some peace. When he becomes friends with Chyvonne, a new girl at school, he doesn't know how to get close to her without revealing his secret and making himself even more vulnerable. Spending time with Chyvonne spurs Travis to try to discover why his mother can't seem to face his very existence. It's only when he learns about the art form of paper cutting that he realizes there might be other ways to make himself feel adrenalin-fueled and in control.</p>
<p>Although self-harm through cutting is a problem usually associated with teenage girls, many young men are involved in different sorts of self-injury. This story explores a teenager's motivations for cutting and the options for overcoming the need to self-injure. </p>
</section>
<blockquote>I received this book for free from NetGalley in exchange for an honest review. This does not affect my opinion of the book or the content of my review.</blockquote>
<p><i>Cutter Boy</i> by Cristy Watson should probably come with a trigger warning. The book deals with bullying, feelings of being ignored or unloved, and with cutting. The story is not necessarily a good read for someone who is triggered by any of these things.</p>
<p>A teen boy cuts himself to feel better – to release angst or pain related to being bullied, being ignored by his parents, or anything else that makes him feel bad. Then a new girl moves into town who seems to like him. Between this new girl and a substitute teacher who shows him incredible art made from cut paper, he starts to wonder if there’s a better way.</p>
<p>This book, as I said, should come with a trigger warning. While none of the subject matter of this book is triggering for me, I know plenty of teens who would be triggered by this book. Some might be triggered to relapse into cutting again. Others might take courage that perhaps there might actually be a better way to deal with their daily struggles. Teens who have issues with bullying or cutting should probably be supervised by a parent or trusted friend while reading the book to ensure the subject matter doesn’t cause issues for them.</p>
<p>This book is well written and honestly, seems to be rather realistic in some aspects. It is possible that the depictions of bullying, cutting, etc., may not be accurate. I do not have personal knowledge in these areas, so I cannot be certain that it is accurate but it at least seems realistic to me. The characters are wonderful and everything that Travis feels makes so much sense when certain facts are finally revealed.</p>
<p>I gave this one 4 out of 5 stars. I recommend this book to those struggling with cutting for the simple fact that this book can show them there is a better way and that they might find that if they look hard enough or hold on long enough that there is a better way to handle their problems.</p></article></li>

<p>I love a good thriller and let me tell you, <i>The Bomb Maker’s Daughter</i> by Thomas Ryan was an excellent one.</p>
<p>A pre-teen girl is being sought by men who want to use her for nefarious purposes. A man she doesn’t know becomes dedicated to saving her and her family. Add a possibly budding romance with a CIA agent and you have a damn good book.</p>
<p>The constant danger, wondering who is behind it all, and why they want Arina – an eleven-year-old girl – makes this an edge-of-your-seat thriller. You won’t want to put it down. I know I didn’t.</p>
<p>This book is well written and has interesting and likeable characters, excluding the villains of course. I might just worry about you, dear reader, if you happen to like the villains. Just saying. The action scenes keep you on your toes and it’s very hard to put down. You just have to know what happens next.</p>
<p>I gave this one 4 out of 5 stars. I definitely recommend this book for action and thriller fans, or anyone looking to check these genres out.</p></article></li>
