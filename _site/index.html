<p class="review__description"><i>I am my beloved's and my beloved is mine.... --from the Song of Songs</i></p>
<p>Did you know that God loves you with a passion--and He wrote a love song to help you experience that love in a personal way?</p>
<p>Tucked away in the pages of Scripture is one of the most fascinating and most misunderstood books of the Bible: the Song of Songs. Although the Song of Songs details a passionate, earthly love story, it is intended to illuminate the best love story, the intense love God has for us, His beloved.</p>
<p>n He Calls You Beautiful, Bible teacher Dee Brestin explores this love song from God to reveal transformative truths for each of us, whether married, single, or widowed. With rich contemporary illustrations and insight from biblical scholars, Dee shows how God uses poetry and exquisite images to illuminate the intimacy that Jesus longs to have with you.</p>
<p>God calls you to know His love not only in your head but also in your heart. He sings over you a song of love, a song of salvation, a song of hope. A Song of songs.</p>
<p>Includes an in-depth Bible study for use individually or in a group setting.</p>

<p>I’m generally looking for new Bible study books and when given the chance to review <i>He Calls You Beautiful</i> I thought I’d hit the jackpot. Finally, someone could explain to me why in the world Song of Songs (Song of Solomon in some Bibles) was even included in the Bible, because it just didn’t seem to fit.</p>
<p>Sadly, I just wasn’t impressed by this book. It was difficult for me to get interested in it. The writing isn’t bad, in fact, the writing is beautifully done. But for some reason the material presented just didn’t resonate with me. Perhaps it is because I’m not in the right time/place in my life, so this isn’t a message that I need to hear?</p>
<p>I love that the book includes Bible study material for both individuals and small groups. The subject matter is such that when I saw that it included Bible study materials, I figured it would be specifically for individuals because, well, the message is to each person <b>individually</b>. The message would seem to be that Heavenly Father and Jesus love <b>you</b>. The message is for <b>you</b>. But, it’s really for everyone because God and Jesus love everyone.</p>
<p>I gave the book 2 stars because it’s not horrible and in all honesty, if I come back to it at another time in my life, it might well work out for me a lot better. Perhaps right now just wasn’t the right time for this message for me.</p></article></li>

<p>I really wanted to read this book. I really wanted to like this book. But after getting a third of the way through the book and still finding that it just didn’t capture or keep my interest, I knew. This book was destined for the abandoned books shelf.</p>
<p>I don’t know if the problem was that I came in on the 3rd book of a series or if the book simply is as dry and boring as I think it is. To be honest, I reached Chapter 11 and felt that the book was just moving at a snail’s pace. Usually the books I read are a touch more fast paced than this or at least they’re interesting enough to keep me going. But several chapters alone were dedicated to Josie and her friends having dinner and talking about the case and that, for me, was just too much time being taken to get things moving.</p>
<p>I did appreciate the fact that even as a new believer, Josie is able to send up heartfelt prayers at pretty much any time she chooses – something I myself still struggle to do. But other than that, I have to say, I just wasn’t into it.</p>
<p>This one gets 0 stars because I abandoned it. I may try to read it again, but it’s unlikely.</p></article></li>

<p class="review__description">Among the many pressing social concerns that have galvanized evangelical Christians’ response—abortion, human trafficking, environmental degradation, and many others—the care of animals has received relatively little attention.</p>
<p>Yet as author Sarah Withrow King deftly uncovers in Vegangelical, animal stewardship is a necessary aspect of a holistic ethic of Christian peace and justice. Indeed, care for animal welfare correspondingly strengthens our care for environmental and human flourishing.</p>
<p>Practical, restrained in its conclusions, and grounded on a broader theology of Christian compassion, Vegangelical calls readers to a greater attentiveness to one of the primary relationships in God’s created order, that between humans and animals.</p>

<p>As a vegetarian Christian who struggles daily with whether or not it is all right from a faith perspective to even be a vegetarian. I’ve had Romans 14:2 KJV “For one believeth that he may eat all things: another, who is weak, eateth herbs” used against me as a reason not to be vegetarian. So you can imagine my surprise to see a book that actually uses research into Biblical principles for not only being vegetarian but being vegan.</p>
<p>Sarah Withrow King holds a Masters’ Degree in Theology, so the theological and Biblical research in this book is sound. It makes sense. God created the creatures and commanded us to be good stewards of our planet and His other creatures. She even takes on the tricky question of whether or not Jesus ate fish (or other animals for that matter).</p>
<p>While she makes several good points regarding the reasons in which from a faith standpoint it not only is appropriate to be vegetarian or vegan, but also that it can grow your faith, Mrs. King does take the time to do a bit of animal activism in there as well. Yes, she does use it to drive home the point about the Biblical commands from God about being a good steward of His world, but much of it does actually remind me a lot of what I see/hear from PETA (for whom the author used to work).</p>
<p>The book is very interesting and easy to follow, although I fear that for Christians who are currently meat-eaters, it may be quite off-putting because it will step on their toes quite a bit. But the fact of the matter is, it is a great read for those of use who don’t consume meat and are wondering if it truly is all right for a Christian to be vegetarian/vegan after God said we could eat animals for food. There’s a great commentary on that scripture from Genesis in this book as well.</p>
<p>I give this one a solid 4 stars, only because the reading could get a bit on the dry side at times.</p></article></li>
