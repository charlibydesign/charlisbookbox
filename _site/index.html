<p class="review__description"><b>Perfect for fans of Sandra Brown and Iris Johannsen.</b></p>
<p>In 1945, an Austrian girl discovers a priceless Nazi treasure near a remote alpine lake and sets in motion a decades-old secret that will change lives for generations to come.</p>
 <p>Many years later, classical pianist Maggie O'Shea is preparing her return to the world of music. Instead, a nightmare of a haunting rhapsody and hundreds of roses from a deranged stalker propel her into a world of terror. Forces drive her to revisit the mystery of her mother's death, her father's startling disappearance, and a terrible secret from World War II. Maggie finds herself on a collision course with a brutal, disfigured killer who threatens those she holds dear—an aging pianist with a long-buried secret, a haunted cellist, a charismatic Maestro, and the crusty retired colonel she has come to love.</p>
 <p>Chord by chord, Rachmaninoff's Rhapsody becomes the heart of this story of profound loss, courage and love. Music tells our stories ...</p>

<blockquote>I received a copy of this book free from Edelweiss+ to facilitate my review. All opinions given are 100% my own.</blockquote>
<p>I wanted to like Dark Rhapsody – and I did… at first. But then, I just lost interest. It wasn’t that it switched between character points of view because that’s normal and I don’t have a problem with it. It also wasn’t that the book was lacking in action, because the book isn’t. It’s got plenty of intrigue, plenty of action, and plenty that should have kept me interested. But… I just wasn’t.</p>
<p>The book itself is great. I cannot deny that the book, up to where I left off, was great. It was just that for some reason, I lost interest in the book. Perhaps it is my overwhelming NetGalley TBR pile that I keep adding books to because I’m being requested to. Perhaps it is because I have a TBR pile a mile high of eBooks that I own. Or perhaps right now just isn’t the time for me to finish this book.</p>
<p>I’ll definitely be getting my own copy of this book – and looking to see if there is a book that goes before it, as it seems as though this is a sequel to some other book. Perhaps that is part of my problem as well. I don’t care to read books out of series, so perhaps I just need to get the previous book(s). I <b>do</b> recommend this book, I just couldn’t seem to finish it at the moment.</p></article></li>

<p class="review__description">Is love worth betraying everything? Plunge into the second adventure in the internationally bestselling Mortal Instruments series and “prepare to be hooked” (<i>Entertainment Weekly</i>)..</p>
<p>Clary Fray just wishes that her life would go back to normal. But what's normal when you're a demon-slaying Shadowhunter, your mother is in a magically induced coma, and you can suddenly see Downworlders like werewolves, vampires, and faeries? If Clary left the world of the Shadowhunters behind, it would mean more time with her best friend, Simon, who's becoming more than a friend. But the Shadowhunting world isn't ready to let her go -- especially her handsome, infuriating, newfound brother, Jace. And Clary's only chance to help her mother is to track down rogue Shadowhunter Valentine, who is probably insane, certainly evil—and also her father.</p>
<p>To complicate matters, someone in New York City is murdering Downworlder children. Is Valentine behind the killings—and if he is, what is he trying to do? When the second of the Mortal Instruments, the Soul-Sword, is stolen, the terrifying Inquisitor arrives to investigate and zooms right in on Jace. How can Clary stop Valentine if Jace is willing to betray everything he believes in to help their father?</p>
<p>In this breathtaking sequel to <i>City of Bones</i>, Cassandra Clare lures her readers back into the dark grip of New York City's Downworld, where love is never safe and power becomes the deadliest temptation.</p>
</section>
<p>The sequel to <i>City of Bones, City of Ashes</i> is no less addicting and action packed than it’s predecessor. Just like <i>City of Bones</i>, I didn’t want to put the book down. Lately, that seems like a near impossibility for me.</p>
<p>I realized after perusing the library’s website that there are actually six books in The Mortal Instruments series as opposed to five. For some reason I managed to miss the fact that a sixth book came out entirely. That just makes me even happier because I don’t want this story to end!</p>
<p>I’ve come to absolutely adore Jace and Clary but I’m still not sure if I really like Isabelle all that much. Alec is growing on me and while I know part of his story because of all the Tumblr posts about the Shadowhunters TV series, I can’t wait to see how it plays out in the books. Luke is another favorite character. And while I hated The Inquisitor, I was sad to see how her portion of the story ended.</p>
<p>I can’t wait for the third book to become available again – I had to turn in books 3-5 because they were due and had holds on them. I’ve got holds on all four of the remaining books and I can’t wait to get my hands on them!</p></article></li>

<p class="review__description">Don’t miss <i>Shadowhunters: The Mortal Instruments</i>, soon to be an Freeform original series. Discover the world it was based on in the first installment of the internationally bestselling Mortal Instruments series and “prepare to be hooked” (<i>Entertainment Weekly</i>).</p>
<p>Enter the world of the Shadowhunters in this special edition of the New York Times bestselling <i>City of Bones</i>, complete with gorgeous cover art from the upcoming Freeform Original Series, <i>Shadowhunters</i>.</p>
<p>When Clary Fray heads out to the Pandemonium Club in New York City, she hardly expects to witness a murder—much less a murder committed by three teenagers covered with strange tattoos and brandishing bizarre weapons. And she’s more than a little startled when the body disappears into thin air. Soon Clary is introduced to the world of the Shadowhunters, a secret cadre of warriors dedicated to driving demons out of our world and back to their own. And Clary is introduced with a vengeance, when her mother disappears and Clary herself is almost killed by a grotesque monster. How could a mere human survive such an attack and kill a demon? The Shadowhunters would like to know…</p>
</section>
<p>I’ve been dying to get my hands on this series for a LONG time, so when I saw all five were available at my local library, I pounced. I read City of Bones in 2 days, which is pretty fast for me with a book that is 485 pages.</p>
<p>This book was definitely worth the hype I’d seen for it. It’s amazing! And the Shadowhunters TV series? Doesn’t do the book justice. In fact, I didn’t like the TV series (I know, blasphemy) so I was sincerely hoping the books would be far better. I wasn’t disappointed.</p>
<p>I love Clary & Jace… not fond of Isabelle or Alec. I’d like to take Valentine out and just… well… get rid of him because he’s such a royal pain as a bad guy. But then again, if I didn’t want to get rid of him, he wouldn’t be a very good bad guy now would he? Simon’s a pretty cool character as well. I love how he feels about Clary although sometimes the way he treats her just sucks.</p>
<p>I can’t wait to delve into the other books – I just hope I can read them all before I have to take them back!</p></article></li>
