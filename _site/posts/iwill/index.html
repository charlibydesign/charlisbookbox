<p class="review__description">Could you be the answer to the problems you see?   Every day we are faced with the needs of those around us. Emotional. Physical. Spiritual. What are we to do about it? Are these problems for our pastors to address or is there a way for the church member to make an impact that will last?   Bestselling author Thom S. Rainer answers these questions by offering nine simple traits that you can incorporate into your life no matter your background, stage of life, or sense of capability. You can do it. Now it's time to just stand up and say you will!</p>

<blockquote>I received this book for free from NetGalley in exchange for an honest review. This does not affect my opinion of the book or the content of my review.</blockquote>
<p>This book will definitely step on some readers’ toes. I’ve always heard that a good sermon or a good book on how to be a proper Christian will step on your toes. That’s not always a good thing. In the case of I Will, it is.</p>
<p>Too many times Christians (and non-Christians as well) focus too much on themselves. What they want. What they feel they need. How they think the church and other people in it should act. I fully admit even as a non-Christian that I have a specific idea of how a church I attend should handle their affairs. I have a specific idea of how the music should be, how the preacher should preach, how the congregation should act. And that’s not OK.</p>
<p>I Will is about changing the attitude of church members from being focused on themselves, what they want, what they feel they need, and putting that focus on others. Serving others. Becoming involved in the church not because you “have to” but because you desire to.</p>
<p>Your toes will be stepped on if you exhibit any of the “bad” behaviors in this book. But if you take the time to read and learn, you will grow and leave those behaviors behind.</p></p>
