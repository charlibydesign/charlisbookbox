<p class="review__description">A Dead Body--A Cryptic Clue. Will Jo Oliver Solve the Riddle in Time?
Police Chief Jo Oliver needed a little time to herself. But when her escape to Wisconsin turns deadly, she teams up with FBI agent Nick Vitarello, hoping to catch the Bow Tie Killer. Their romantic past and complicated present lead them into uncharted territory as they match wits with a psychopath bent on destroying everything they hold dear.</p>

<blockquote>I received this book for free from NetGalley in exchange for an honest review. This does not affect my opinion of the book or the content of my review.</blockquote>
<p>I really wanted to read this book. I really wanted to like this book. But after getting a third of the way through the book and still finding that it just didn’t capture or keep my interest, I knew. This book was destined for the abandoned books shelf.</p>
<p>I don’t know if the problem was that I came in on the 3rd book of a series or if the book simply is as dry and boring as I think it is. To be honest, I reached Chapter 11 and felt that the book was just moving at a snail’s pace. Usually the books I read are a touch more fast paced than this or at least they’re interesting enough to keep me going. But several chapters alone were dedicated to Josie and her friends having dinner and talking about the case and that, for me, was just too much time being taken to get things moving.</p>
<p>I did appreciate the fact that even as a new believer, Josie is able to send up heartfelt prayers at pretty much any time she chooses – something I myself still struggle to do. But other than that, I have to say, I just wasn’t into it.</p>
<p>This one gets 0 stars because I abandoned it. I may try to read it again, but it’s unlikely.</p></p>
