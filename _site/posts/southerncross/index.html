<p class="review__description">"Now boarding: Southern Cross, tanker flight 73 to Titan! Alex Braith is on board retracing her sister's steps to the refinery moon, hoping to collect her remains and find some answers. The questions keep coming though--how did her sister die? And why does she always feel like she's being watched? Inspired by classic mysteries and weird fiction, Southern Cross is a crucible of creeping anxiety and fear as Braith struggles with the ghosts of her past on board a ship that holds secrets best kept buried."</p>

<p>Ok, here goes. I am not usually a comics/graphic novel person. Probably because I’m not big on pictures in my books. I literally dislike graphics, pictures, graphs, charts, etc., in my books when I’m reading. I’d rather have the information with nothing breaking it up other than maybe different colored/sized headlines.</p>
<p>I have to say, Southern Cross was very interesting. I wasn’t sure what to expect when I started reading it and I certainly didn’t expect the ending! It kept me interested from beginning to end. While in some spots it seemed the artwork could use some work, that could also have been due to my reading it on a computer screen instead of on paper as comics/graphic novels were meant to be.</p>
<p>The story line is fascinating and honestly, I’m hoping that the author/artist is intending to continue past the ending of this volume because I’d love to know what happens next!</p></p>
