<p class="review__description">Passion that takes no prisoners, and love that tests the limits of ecstasy . . .
Fenn Lockwood comes alive in the shadows. Though he might have physically survived the kidnapping that stole his childhood, the trauma and pain he lived through have marked him forever. Now the only place where Fenn can be himself is within the walls of his private BDSM world-a place of erotic obsession, where desire isn't just captured . . . it's bound.</p>
<p>Hayden Thorne knows that behind Fenn's hardened exterior is a man worth fighting for. Yet to save him from the past that still haunts him, Hayden will have to abandon every inhibition she's ever had and venture into Fenn's intoxicatingly sensual world. Each tantalizing second she spends in Fenn's searing embrace is more delicious than the last and soon Hayden begins to think that she may never want to leave such torturous bliss . . .</p>

<blockquote>I received this book for free from NetGalley in exchange for an honest review. This does not affect my opinion of the book or the content of my review.</blockquote>
<p>It took me a bit to get into this one, but once I did, I was hooked. I admit, I have a BDSM fetish when I read–if the fan fiction I tend to read is any indication–so any book that includes that is generally a winner with me. I have to say though, this is the first time I’ve actually liked any of the erotica novels I’ve tried reading.</p>
<p>I usually find romance/erotica novels to be poorly written and laughable with what the characters are trying to do in the bedroom, but I definitely didn’t find that issue in this novel. Plus, most romance/erotica novels have little in the way of actual story other than the copious amounts of sex that are featured. This book actually has a story that goes with it and it’s an intriguing one at that.</p>
<p>Yes, this is the second in a series, but you don’t need to read the first book, The Gilded Cuff, to understand what is going on or enjoy this book. The story line is a great one and it stands on its own very well. I have to say that I do want to read The Gilded Cuff and the story that comes after this one, The Gilded Chain, because if I enjoyed The Gilded Cage this much, I’m sure to enjoy those as well.</p></p>
