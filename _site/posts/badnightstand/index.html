<p><b>Title:</b> <i>Bad Night Stand</i><br>
<b>Series:</b> Billionaire's Club #1 <br>

<b>Format:</b> eARC<br>

<b>Rating:</b> ★★★★★</p>
<p class="review__description">The man had seemed so innocent in the bar—okay, not innocent, per se. He’d been hot, hard, and possessed a butt that I wanted to bite like the last chocolate chip cookie in my stash. </p>
<p>He’d also skipped out of town faster than a villain in a B movie, leaving me woefully unsatisfied. I’d chalked the whole incident up to a bad night stand and moved on with my life.</p>
<p>That was before the news of a failed IUD. Before the plus sign. Before Jordan showed back up determined to make that night up to me.</p>
<p>I didn’t want a baby or a payday or a sexy, stubborn man in my life. I wanted to go back in time and pretend none of it had happened.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, my life had become all about that plus sign . . . and there wasn’t a damn thing I could do about it.</p>

<blockquote>I received this book for free from NetGalley in exchange for an honest review. This does not affect my opinion of the book or the content of my review.</blockquote>
<p>I’m not one much for the romance genre, even though it seems like I have quite a few in my NetGalley queue. But Bad Night Stand called to me because it seemed like it would be right up my alley.</p>
<p>I wasn’t wrong. I loved it. And in all honesty, I’m sincerely hoping that the author puts more of her books on NetGalley because I’m dying to read them all!</p>
<p>Abby and Jordan are great main characters. The development is great, even if you have to wait a bit to find out what makes them tick. You’ll probably hate Abby’s dad, which isn’t a surprise, but you’ll love Abby and Jordan. You’ll also come to love Seraphina, Bec, and Heather. And we can’t forget Hunter – he’s an absolute doll and you’ll love him as soon as he pops up in the book.</p>
<p>This story will tug your heart strings, make you laugh, and tick you off. There is some strong language in the book, which doesn’t bother me, but I thought I would mention it for those who might be bothered by strong language. There are also a few sex scenes for those who aren’t into that type of thing either.</p>
<p>This well written story is the first in a series and I am seriously chomping at the bit for the second book in the series after reading the epilogue. Trust me on this, you will be too!</p></p>
