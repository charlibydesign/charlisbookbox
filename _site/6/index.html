<p class="review__description">No one wants to see a church die. And yet, far too many churches are dying. For more than twenty-five years, Dr. Thom Rainer has helped churches grow, reverse the trends of decline, and has autopsied those that have died. From this experience, he has discovered twelve consistent themes among those churches that have died. Yet, it's not gloom and doom because from those twelve themes, lessons on how to keep your church alive have emerged.
Whether your church is vibrant or dying, whether you are a pastor or a church member, Autopsy of a Deceased Church will walk you through the radical paths necessary to keep your church alive to the glory of God and advancement of Christ's Kingdom!</p>

<p>I found this book to be quite interesting and eye opening.  I’d always wondered what could possibly cause a particular church location to shut its doors and now I have a fairly good idea of what those reasons are.</p>
<p>Rainer doesn’t sugar coat the truth about why churches die. While to someone who might be a member of a dying church might see this as Rainer being a jerk, he really isn’t. He’s telling it like it is – this is a fairly apt description of what is killing your church and here are some ways you can fix it.</p>
<p>I like that the book doesn’t just cover what’s wrong with a dying church but also gives ways in which it can be fixed–or in the case of a church that is clearly dying and unable to be turned around, how it can die with dignity. I’ll admit some of the suggestions made me curious–especially the ones for how to allow your church to die with dignity–because in all honesty, I see some of the signs of a church that is becoming ill in the church my roommates attend.</p>
<p>I definitely recommend this book for anyone who feels their church may be on the path to death. This book is a great tool for pastors and congregations to help determine what stage a church is in and how to reverse it if possible.</p></article></li>

<p class="review__description"><b>A triumphant return to the world of City of Stairs.</b> A generation ago, the city of Voortyashtan was the stronghold of the god of war and death, the birthplace of fearsome supernatural sentinels who killed and subjugated millions.  Now, the city’s god is dead. The city itself lies in ruins. And to its new military occupiers, the once-powerful capital is a wasteland of sectarian violence and bloody uprisings. So it makes perfect sense that General Turyin Mulaghesh— foul-mouthed hero of the battle of Bulikov, rumored war criminal, ally of an embattled Prime Minister—has been exiled there to count down the days until she can draw her pension and be forgotten.   At least, it makes the perfect cover story.  The truth is that the general has been pressed into service one last time, dispatched to investigate a discovery with the potential to change the world--or destroy it.  The trouble is that this old soldier isn't sure she's still got what it takes to be the hero.</p>

<p>City of Blades started out as a book I didn’t think I’d be able to get into. At first it just didn’t seem to be that interesting. I’m glad I stuck it out because if I hadn’t, I’d have missed one of the best books I’ve read in the last year!</p>
<p>The second book in a series that began with City of Stairs, City of Blades can easily stand on its own. I had no issues with understanding what was going on. There is enough of the backstory to allow the reader to know what is going on and what happened in the past to make the story clear.</p>
<p>This book is kind of like a fantasy version of a mystery thriller. There is a bit of a whodunit in City of Blades as well as a fair bit of action. The world woven here is much like our own world but not quite. Many of our own conveniences exist here – electricity, weaponry, etc. – but the world is most definitely not the world as we know it. In this world, Divinities existed but were able to be destroyed, along with their miracles, an interesting concept.</p>
<p>I love Mulaghesh. Her character is what I feel is the consummate solider. She serves and she feels that those who do not serve are unworthy of the title of soldier. I’m also quite fond of Sigrund. I can’t really say why, I just like him a lot.</p>
<p>This book is great for anyone looking for a new breed of fantasy book to get into.</p></article></li>

<p class="review__description">Forced to make a bargain... One drunken night in Cuba lands Captain Valeryn Barone in a life or death situation. To escape the gallows, Valeryn must agree to a bargain only a fool would make: Escort the tempting and tenacious niece of his captor across the Caribbean or lose his ship, his crew and his life! The caveat? The beautiful Spanish woman must remain untouched for the entire voyage.</p>
<p>Determined to get what she wants... Catalina Montoya will stop at nothing to get what she wants-even when trouble is certain. Sent to live with her uncle after a scandalous affair, Catalina intends to concentrate on her dream to become a renowned naturalist. She never expected her uncle would send her with a notorious pirate to further her studies. Worse, she never expected to want the devilishly handsome pirate more than anything else. </p>
 <p>It's a battle of wills... Now Catalina only has 8 weeks to seduce Valeryn and collect her specimens before he returns her to her uncle. And Valeryn has 8 weeks to secure his redemption. Except neither would be that lucky. Not when ruthless enemies threaten to destroy them at every turn. Can Valeryn save those that foolishly depend on him? Can he resist Catalina's heart? Does a dead man walking even have a chance?</p>

<p>I have to say, I enjoyed this book. I’m not a big “romance” fan anymore. Most of the books just seem to be far too boring or have little-to-no story beyond the sexual tension between the hero and heroine of the novel. I’ll be honest, there is plenty of sexual tension between Catalina and Valeryn, but there was also a story line being carried out beyond the sexual tension.</p>
<p>Pirates have long been a favorite thing of mine to read about when reading romance novels but it seems that not too many authors delve into the realm of pirates anymore. Or maybe I’m just not looking in the right places. In any case, it is nice to know that it isn’t all military-based books or books that should technically be considered erotica instead of romance. This book has some sexual scenes but not nearly as much as one would expect from a romance novel being written and published today.</p>
<p>Being that this book is self-published, I am highly impressed with the quality of the writing, because let’s face it, a lot of self-published novels aren’t very good. Many of them are poorly written or poorly edited and most times the poor writing style or shoddy editing detracts from an otherwise good story idea. Thankfully neither is the case here. I look forward to reading other novels from the Romancing the Pirate series.</p></article></li>
