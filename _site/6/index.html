<p>At first glance you’d never know this was a Christian fiction story. The way the book starts out, you’d think you had started your ordinary, run of the mill action/adventure/mystery novel. But as you go on, you see sprinklings of why this is a Christian fiction story.</p>
<p>The story was a very good one–and I admit that the mark of Christianity is not over done so the reader isn’t feeling left bombarded by calls to become a Christian as often happens with books that contain members who aren’t yet a Christian. In fact, while the Christianity in the book is obvious, it shouldn’t make anyone uncomfortable if they simply wanted to read a good book.</p>
<p>This book moves fairly quickly, which is nice. There isn’t a lot of superfluous writing here–no lengthy descriptions of inconsequential things, just good solid storytelling. I kept wondering who was the mysterious “Jefe” and honestly I had the wrong person pegged, which is actually kind of unusual for me. I have to say, this book deserves every one of the four stars I gave it.</p></article></li>

<p class="review__description">Once the world's most famous chef, Gavin Cruikshank's been in a self-imposed exile for years. His little foodie television program has since evolved into STARVE, an arena sport that pits chef against chef for the pleasure of their super-rich patrons. It's a stain on a once-noble profession, and Chef Gavin is ready to go to war to stop it. Two things stand in his way: his arch rival Roman Algiers, and his adult daughter Angie, who probably just wants her dad back and acting normal.</p>

<p>Starve was, in a word, amazing. I was absolutely captivated, only breaking when I need to blink my eyes away from my screen for a few seconds. I didn’t want it to end and was sad when it did.</p>
<p>What intrigued me was the fact that the graphic novel was based around a cooking show. Around a celebrity chef who’d disappeared for years on the other side of the world and suddenly is brought back to compete on the show he created. It’s so hard to describe how I feel about this graphic novel. I’m sincerely hoping I can have a chance to read and review Volume 2 because the way this ended, there has to be a Volume 2 or I might just cry!</p></article></li>

<p class="review__description">"Now boarding: Southern Cross, tanker flight 73 to Titan! Alex Braith is on board retracing her sister's steps to the refinery moon, hoping to collect her remains and find some answers. The questions keep coming though--how did her sister die? And why does she always feel like she's being watched? Inspired by classic mysteries and weird fiction, Southern Cross is a crucible of creeping anxiety and fear as Braith struggles with the ghosts of her past on board a ship that holds secrets best kept buried."</p>

<p>Ok, here goes. I am not usually a comics/graphic novel person. Probably because I’m not big on pictures in my books. I literally dislike graphics, pictures, graphs, charts, etc., in my books when I’m reading. I’d rather have the information with nothing breaking it up other than maybe different colored/sized headlines.</p>
<p>I have to say, Southern Cross was very interesting. I wasn’t sure what to expect when I started reading it and I certainly didn’t expect the ending! It kept me interested from beginning to end. While in some spots it seemed the artwork could use some work, that could also have been due to my reading it on a computer screen instead of on paper as comics/graphic novels were meant to be.</p>
<p>The story line is fascinating and honestly, I’m hoping that the author/artist is intending to continue past the ending of this volume because I’d love to know what happens next!</p></article></li>
