<p class="review__description">Among the many pressing social concerns that have galvanized evangelical Christians’ response—abortion, human trafficking, environmental degradation, and many others—the care of animals has received relatively little attention.</p>
<p>Yet as author Sarah Withrow King deftly uncovers in Vegangelical, animal stewardship is a necessary aspect of a holistic ethic of Christian peace and justice. Indeed, care for animal welfare correspondingly strengthens our care for environmental and human flourishing.</p>
<p>Practical, restrained in its conclusions, and grounded on a broader theology of Christian compassion, Vegangelical calls readers to a greater attentiveness to one of the primary relationships in God’s created order, that between humans and animals.</p>

<p>As a vegetarian Christian who struggles daily with whether or not it is all right from a faith perspective to even be a vegetarian. I’ve had Romans 14:2 KJV “For one believeth that he may eat all things: another, who is weak, eateth herbs” used against me as a reason not to be vegetarian. So you can imagine my surprise to see a book that actually uses research into Biblical principles for not only being vegetarian but being vegan.</p>
<p>Sarah Withrow King holds a Masters’ Degree in Theology, so the theological and Biblical research in this book is sound. It makes sense. God created the creatures and commanded us to be good stewards of our planet and His other creatures. She even takes on the tricky question of whether or not Jesus ate fish (or other animals for that matter).</p>
<p>While she makes several good points regarding the reasons in which from a faith standpoint it not only is appropriate to be vegetarian or vegan, but also that it can grow your faith, Mrs. King does take the time to do a bit of animal activism in there as well. Yes, she does use it to drive home the point about the Biblical commands from God about being a good steward of His world, but much of it does actually remind me a lot of what I see/hear from PETA (for whom the author used to work).</p>
<p>The book is very interesting and easy to follow, although I fear that for Christians who are currently meat-eaters, it may be quite off-putting because it will step on their toes quite a bit. But the fact of the matter is, it is a great read for those of use who don’t consume meat and are wondering if it truly is all right for a Christian to be vegetarian/vegan after God said we could eat animals for food. There’s a great commentary on that scripture from Genesis in this book as well.</p>
<p>I give this one a solid 4 stars, only because the reading could get a bit on the dry side at times.</p></article></li>

<p class="review__description">Passion that takes no prisoners, and love that tests the limits of ecstasy . . .
Fenn Lockwood comes alive in the shadows. Though he might have physically survived the kidnapping that stole his childhood, the trauma and pain he lived through have marked him forever. Now the only place where Fenn can be himself is within the walls of his private BDSM world-a place of erotic obsession, where desire isn't just captured . . . it's bound.</p>
<p>Hayden Thorne knows that behind Fenn's hardened exterior is a man worth fighting for. Yet to save him from the past that still haunts him, Hayden will have to abandon every inhibition she's ever had and venture into Fenn's intoxicatingly sensual world. Each tantalizing second she spends in Fenn's searing embrace is more delicious than the last and soon Hayden begins to think that she may never want to leave such torturous bliss . . .</p>

<p>It took me a bit to get into this one, but once I did, I was hooked. I admit, I have a BDSM fetish when I read–if the fan fiction I tend to read is any indication–so any book that includes that is generally a winner with me. I have to say though, this is the first time I’ve actually liked any of the erotica novels I’ve tried reading.</p>
<p>I usually find romance/erotica novels to be poorly written and laughable with what the characters are trying to do in the bedroom, but I definitely didn’t find that issue in this novel. Plus, most romance/erotica novels have little in the way of actual story other than the copious amounts of sex that are featured. This book actually has a story that goes with it and it’s an intriguing one at that.</p>
<p>Yes, this is the second in a series, but you don’t need to read the first book, The Gilded Cuff, to understand what is going on or enjoy this book. The story line is a great one and it stands on its own very well. I have to say that I do want to read The Gilded Cuff and the story that comes after this one, The Gilded Chain, because if I enjoyed The Gilded Cage this much, I’m sure to enjoy those as well.</p></article></li>

<p>At first glance you’d never know this was a Christian fiction story. The way the book starts out, you’d think you had started your ordinary, run of the mill action/adventure/mystery novel. But as you go on, you see sprinklings of why this is a Christian fiction story.</p>
<p>The story was a very good one–and I admit that the mark of Christianity is not over done so the reader isn’t feeling left bombarded by calls to become a Christian as often happens with books that contain members who aren’t yet a Christian. In fact, while the Christianity in the book is obvious, it shouldn’t make anyone uncomfortable if they simply wanted to read a good book.</p>
<p>This book moves fairly quickly, which is nice. There isn’t a lot of superfluous writing here–no lengthy descriptions of inconsequential things, just good solid storytelling. I kept wondering who was the mysterious “Jefe” and honestly I had the wrong person pegged, which is actually kind of unusual for me. I have to say, this book deserves every one of the four stars I gave it.</p></article></li>

<p class="review__description">Once the world's most famous chef, Gavin Cruikshank's been in a self-imposed exile for years. His little foodie television program has since evolved into STARVE, an arena sport that pits chef against chef for the pleasure of their super-rich patrons. It's a stain on a once-noble profession, and Chef Gavin is ready to go to war to stop it. Two things stand in his way: his arch rival Roman Algiers, and his adult daughter Angie, who probably just wants her dad back and acting normal.</p>

<p>Starve was, in a word, amazing. I was absolutely captivated, only breaking when I need to blink my eyes away from my screen for a few seconds. I didn’t want it to end and was sad when it did.</p>
<p>What intrigued me was the fact that the graphic novel was based around a cooking show. Around a celebrity chef who’d disappeared for years on the other side of the world and suddenly is brought back to compete on the show he created. It’s so hard to describe how I feel about this graphic novel. I’m sincerely hoping I can have a chance to read and review Volume 2 because the way this ended, there has to be a Volume 2 or I might just cry!</p></article></li>

<p class="review__description">"Now boarding: Southern Cross, tanker flight 73 to Titan!

Inspired by classic mysteries and weird fiction, Southern Cross is a crucible of creeping anxiety and fear as Braith struggles with the ghosts of her past on board a ship that holds secrets best kept buried."</p>

<p>Ok, here goes. I am not usually a comics/graphic novel person. Probably because I’m not big on pictures in my books. I literally dislike graphics, pictures, graphs, charts, etc., in my books when I’m reading. I’d rather have the information with nothing breaking it up other than maybe different colored/sized headlines.</p>
<p>I have to say, Southern Cross was very interesting. I wasn’t sure what to expect when I started reading it and I certainly didn’t expect the ending! It kept me interested from beginning to end. While in some spots it seemed the artwork could use some work, that could also have been due to my reading it on a computer screen instead of on paper as comics/graphic novels were meant to be.</p>
<p>The story line is fascinating and honestly, I’m hoping that the author/artist is intending to continue past the ending of this volume because I’d love to know what happens next!</p></article></li>
