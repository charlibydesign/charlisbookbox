<p>I really wanted to read this book. I really wanted to like this book. But after getting a third of the way through the book and still finding that it just didn’t capture or keep my interest, I knew. This book was destined for the abandoned books shelf.</p>
<p>I don’t know if the problem was that I came in on the 3rd book of a series or if the book simply is as dry and boring as I think it is. To be honest, I reached Chapter 11 and felt that the book was just moving at a snail’s pace. Usually the books I read are a touch more fast paced than this or at least they’re interesting enough to keep me going. But several chapters alone were dedicated to Josie and her friends having dinner and talking about the case and that, for me, was just too much time being taken to get things moving.</p>
<p>I did appreciate the fact that even as a new believer, Josie is able to send up heartfelt prayers at pretty much any time she chooses – something I myself still struggle to do. But other than that, I have to say, I just wasn’t into it.</p>
<p>This one gets 0 stars because I abandoned it. I may try to read it again, but it’s unlikely.</p></article></li>

<p class="review__description">Among the many pressing social concerns that have galvanized evangelical Christians’ response—abortion, human trafficking, environmental degradation, and many others—the care of animals has received relatively little attention.</p>
<p>Yet as author Sarah Withrow King deftly uncovers in Vegangelical, animal stewardship is a necessary aspect of a holistic ethic of Christian peace and justice. Indeed, care for animal welfare correspondingly strengthens our care for environmental and human flourishing.</p>
<p>Practical, restrained in its conclusions, and grounded on a broader theology of Christian compassion, Vegangelical calls readers to a greater attentiveness to one of the primary relationships in God’s created order, that between humans and animals.</p>

<p>As a vegetarian Christian who struggles daily with whether or not it is all right from a faith perspective to even be a vegetarian. I’ve had Romans 14:2 KJV “For one believeth that he may eat all things: another, who is weak, eateth herbs” used against me as a reason not to be vegetarian. So you can imagine my surprise to see a book that actually uses research into Biblical principles for not only being vegetarian but being vegan.</p>
<p>Sarah Withrow King holds a Masters’ Degree in Theology, so the theological and Biblical research in this book is sound. It makes sense. God created the creatures and commanded us to be good stewards of our planet and His other creatures. She even takes on the tricky question of whether or not Jesus ate fish (or other animals for that matter).</p>
<p>While she makes several good points regarding the reasons in which from a faith standpoint it not only is appropriate to be vegetarian or vegan, but also that it can grow your faith, Mrs. King does take the time to do a bit of animal activism in there as well. Yes, she does use it to drive home the point about the Biblical commands from God about being a good steward of His world, but much of it does actually remind me a lot of what I see/hear from PETA (for whom the author used to work).</p>
<p>The book is very interesting and easy to follow, although I fear that for Christians who are currently meat-eaters, it may be quite off-putting because it will step on their toes quite a bit. But the fact of the matter is, it is a great read for those of use who don’t consume meat and are wondering if it truly is all right for a Christian to be vegetarian/vegan after God said we could eat animals for food. There’s a great commentary on that scripture from Genesis in this book as well.</p>
<p>I give this one a solid 4 stars, only because the reading could get a bit on the dry side at times.</p></article></li>

<p class="review__description">Passion that takes no prisoners, and love that tests the limits of ecstasy . . .
Fenn Lockwood comes alive in the shadows. Though he might have physically survived the kidnapping that stole his childhood, the trauma and pain he lived through have marked him forever. Now the only place where Fenn can be himself is within the walls of his private BDSM world-a place of erotic obsession, where desire isn't just captured . . . it's bound.</p>
<p>Hayden Thorne knows that behind Fenn's hardened exterior is a man worth fighting for. Yet to save him from the past that still haunts him, Hayden will have to abandon every inhibition she's ever had and venture into Fenn's intoxicatingly sensual world. Each tantalizing second she spends in Fenn's searing embrace is more delicious than the last and soon Hayden begins to think that she may never want to leave such torturous bliss . . .</p>

<p>It took me a bit to get into this one, but once I did, I was hooked. I admit, I have a BDSM fetish when I read–if the fan fiction I tend to read is any indication–so any book that includes that is generally a winner with me. I have to say though, this is the first time I’ve actually liked any of the erotica novels I’ve tried reading.</p>
<p>I usually find romance/erotica novels to be poorly written and laughable with what the characters are trying to do in the bedroom, but I definitely didn’t find that issue in this novel. Plus, most romance/erotica novels have little in the way of actual story other than the copious amounts of sex that are featured. This book actually has a story that goes with it and it’s an intriguing one at that.</p>
<p>Yes, this is the second in a series, but you don’t need to read the first book, The Gilded Cuff, to understand what is going on or enjoy this book. The story line is a great one and it stands on its own very well. I have to say that I do want to read The Gilded Cuff and the story that comes after this one, The Gilded Chain, because if I enjoyed The Gilded Cage this much, I’m sure to enjoy those as well.</p></article></li>
