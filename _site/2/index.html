<p class="review__description">Don’t miss <i>Shadowhunters: The Mortal Instruments</i>, soon to be an Freeform original series. Discover the world it was based on in the first installment of the internationally bestselling Mortal Instruments series and “prepare to be hooked” (<i>Entertainment Weekly</i>).</p>
<p>Enter the world of the Shadowhunters in this special edition of the New York Times bestselling <i>City of Bones</i>, complete with gorgeous cover art from the upcoming Freeform Original Series, <i>Shadowhunters</i>.</p>
<p>When Clary Fray heads out to the Pandemonium Club in New York City, she hardly expects to witness a murder—much less a murder committed by three teenagers covered with strange tattoos and brandishing bizarre weapons. And she’s more than a little startled when the body disappears into thin air. Soon Clary is introduced to the world of the Shadowhunters, a secret cadre of warriors dedicated to driving demons out of our world and back to their own. And Clary is introduced with a vengeance, when her mother disappears and Clary herself is almost killed by a grotesque monster. How could a mere human survive such an attack and kill a demon? The Shadowhunters would like to know…</p>
</section>
<p>I’ve been dying to get my hands on this series for a LONG time, so when I saw all five were available at my local library, I pounced. I read City of Bones in 2 days, which is pretty fast for me with a book that is 485 pages.</p>
<p>This book was definitely worth the hype I’d seen for it. It’s amazing! And the Shadowhunters TV series? Doesn’t do the book justice. In fact, I didn’t like the TV series (I know, blasphemy) so I was sincerely hoping the books would be far better. I wasn’t disappointed.</p>
<p>I love Clary & Jace… not fond of Isabelle or Alec. I’d like to take Valentine out and just… well… get rid of him because he’s such a royal pain as a bad guy. But then again, if I didn’t want to get rid of him, he wouldn’t be a very good bad guy now would he? Simon’s a pretty cool character as well. I love how he feels about Clary although sometimes the way he treats her just sucks.</p>
<p>I can’t wait to delve into the other books – I just hope I can read them all before I have to take them back!</p></article></li>

<p class="review__description"><b>Now in mass market paperback, discover a high stakes world with unexpected and sinister twists that's "visual, kinetic, and furiously paced" from Marie Lu, #1 New York Times bestselling author of the Legend series</b></p>
<p>For the millions who log in every day, Warcross isn't just a game--it's a way of life. Struggling to make ends meet, teenage hacker Emika Chen works as a bounty hunter, tracking down players who bet on the game illegally. Needing to make some quick cash, Emika takes a risk and hacks into the opening game of the international Warcross Championships--only to accidentally glitch herself into the action and become an overnight sensation. Convinced she's going to be arrested, Emika is shocked when instead she gets a call from the game's creator, the elusive young billionaire Hideo Tanaka, with an irresistible offer. With no time to lose, Emika's whisked off to Tokyo and thrust into a world of fame and fortune that she's only dreamed of. But soon her investigation uncovers a sinister plot, with major consequences for the entire Warcross empire.</p>

<p>I’d been wanting to read Warcross by Marie Lu since I’d heard it was coming out. I’d tried for it on NetGalley but was turned down – probably due to my seriously ridiculous backlog there. So when I finally found it here in the library, I snapped it up.</p>
<p>The book was well hyped before it came out and so many readers had said it was so good that I expected my mind to be blown. Instead, while it was most definitely good enough to earn it a 4 star review, it wasn’t the mind-blowing experience I’d expected from the hype. In fact, I found it all to easy to put the book down and not pick it up.</p>
<p>The game of Warcross just wasn’t interesting to me, and I found myself putting the book down for a bit whenever a game was described. I was much more interested in figuring out who Zero was – and unfortunately, it wasn’t too difficult to figure it out. Honestly, I’d have waited until Wildcard, the second book in the series to actually reveal who Zero is… even if it was just in the beginning of the new book.</p>
<p>That being said, the book was very well written and I am looking forward to Wildcard being released. I’m hoping to be able to read a copy as soon as the library gets it because the story is an addicting one outside the descriptions of the Warcross games.</p></article></li>

<p><b>Now a Hulu original series starring Reese Witherspoon and Kerry Washington. "I read Little Fires Everywhere in a single, breathless sitting." --Jodi Picoult<br>
"To say I love this book is an understatement. It's a deep psychological mystery about the power of motherhood, the intensity of teenage love, and the danger of perfection. It moved me to tears." --Reese Witherspoon<br>
"Extraordinary . . . books like Little Fires Everywhere don't come along often." --John Green</b></p>
 <p>From the bestselling author of Everything I Never Told You, a riveting novel that traces the intertwined fates of the picture-perfect Richardson family and the enigmatic mother and daughter who upend their lives.</p>
 <p>n Shaker Heights, a placid, progressive suburb of Cleveland, everything is planned--from the layout of the winding roads, to the colors of the houses, to the successful lives its residents will go on to lead. And no one embodies this spirit more than Elena Richardson, whose guiding principle is playing by the rules.</p>
 <p>Enter Mia Warren--an enigmatic artist and single mother--who arrives in this idyllic bubble with her teenaged daughter Pearl, and rents a house from the Richardsons. Soon Mia and Pearl become more than tenants: all four Richardson children are drawn to the mother-daughter pair. But Mia carries with her a mysterious past and a disregard for the status quo that threatens to upend this carefully ordered community.</p>
 <p>When old family friends of the Richardsons attempt to adopt a Chinese-American baby, a custody battle erupts that dramatically divides the town--and puts Mia and Elena on opposing sides. Suspicious of Mia and her motives, Elena is determined to uncover the secrets in Mia's past. But her obsession will come at unexpected and devastating costs.
Little Fires Everywhere explores the weight of secrets, the nature of art and identity, and the ferocious pull of motherhood--and the danger of believing that following the rules can avert disaster.</p>

<p>I’m still trying to figure out exactly how I feel about this book. I mean, I rated it 4 stars, so I obviously I liked it, but I’m still not quite sure how I feel about the book.</p>
<p>Little Fires Everywhere is a wonderful novel. I’m not going to say it isn’t. It’s thought provoking. It will make you laugh, it will make you cry, it will make you angry. You’ll find yourself taking sides on issues raised in the book. You’ll find yourself heartbroken for characters who have lost something. You’ll find yourself hoping that characters get what they are looking for in the end.</p>
<p>I went out of my genre comfort zone for this book. I don’t normally read books that are in the “Fiction” or “Adult Fiction” category unless I’ve been seeing them everywhere – which I’ve been seeing a lot of people talking about this book. I’ve seen where people say it’s slow moving, which I suppose you could say that it is, but I read it in 2 days, so it can’t be that slow moving. Usually when I think of a slow moving book, it takes me over a week to read the book because it moves so slowly that I can’t get into it. I think it is more a matter of the book moves slowly if you simply aren’t interested in it.</p>
<p>I fell in love with the kids in this book – Pearl and Izzy especially. I keep wondering if Trip & Moody really are named that or if they are nicknames for which we simply are never given their proper given names. The kids are just so genuine and I know how Izzy feels because I’ve felt that way on more than one occasion with my family (although in my case it is extended family who make me feel that way, not my parents).</p>
<p>The May Ling Chow/Mirabelle McCullough story line tugged at my heart. I can totally see how both sides felt, but I must admit, I sided with Bebe Chow. You’ll have to tell me which side you chose in that debate.</p>
<p>All in all, the book is a really good read and I do recommend that you check it out if you’re into adult fiction.</p></article></li>

<p>A gang of thieves stage a daring heist from a vault deep below Princeton University's Firestone Library. Their loot is priceless, impossible to resist.</p>
<p>Bruce Cable owns a popular bookstore in the sleepy resort town of Santa Rosa on Camino Island in Florida. He makes his real money, though, as a prominent dealer in rare books. Very few people know that he occasionally dabbles in unsavory ventures.</p>
<p>Mercer Mann is a young novelist with a severe case of writer's block who has recently been laid off from her teaching position. She is approached by an elegant, mysterious woman working for an even more mysterious company. A generous monetary offer convinces Mercer to go undercover and infiltrate Cable's circle of literary friends, to get close to the ringleader, to discover his secrets.</p>
<p>But soon Mercer learns far too much, and there's trouble in paradise--as only John Grisham can deliver it.</p>

<p>While I kind of panned the last John Grisham novel I’d read, it was more because while it involved law and lawyers, it wasn’t what I was expecting.</p>
<p>This novel was a departure from what I recall John Grisham doing previously, but this novel worked. It really did work.</p>
<p>The character development wasn’t completely there, but it also didn’t really need to be. Most of the characters, even though they appeared multiple times, didn’t need the development as they weren’t the main focus of the novel. The characters who did need development had it – Mercer and Bruce Cable. The rest of the characters were more or less window dressing, regardless of how much time you spent reading their words and actions. The only characters that truly mattered in the plot were Mercer and Bruce.</p>
<p>And it was a great book. It was hard for me to put it down to do the other things I needed to get done, but I managed. This book just flowed and I was constantly curious to see how the story would turn out. It turns out a bit differently than you might expect, but that just makes the novel even better.</p>
<p>This one got 4 out 5 stars only because there were some parts of the book I thought could have been taken out and the book wouldn’t have been any less interesting.</p></article></li>

<p class="review__description"><b>#1 New York Times bestselling author John Grisham’s newest legal thriller takes you inside a law firm that’s on shaky ground.“[A] buoyant, mischievous thriller . . . Grisham writes in such an inventive spirit. . . . A treat.”—Janet Maslin, The New York Times</b></p>
<p>Mark, Todd, and Zola came to law school to change the world, to make it a better place. But now, as third-year students, these close friends realize they have been duped. They all borrowed heavily to attend a third-tier for-profit law school so mediocre that its graduates rarely pass the bar exam, let alone get good jobs. And when they learn that their school is one of a chain owned by a shady New York hedge-fund operator who also happens to own a bank specializing in student loans, the three know they have been caught up in The Great Law School Scam.   But maybe there’s a way out. Maybe there’s a way to escape their crushing debt, expose the bank and the scam, and make a few bucks in the process. But to do so, they would first have to quit school. And leaving law school a few short months before graduation would be completely crazy, right? Well, yes and no . . .   Pull up a stool, grab a cold one, and get ready to spend some time at The Rooster Bar. </p>
 <p><b>“Satisfying . . . Grisham [is] at his best when he brings his sardonic sense of humor to the sometimes questionable ethics of law and banking.”—USA Today   “[A] smartly told tale . . . gratifying and all-too-real.”—The Washington Post</b></p>
</section>
<p>I’ll be honest, I haven’t read a John Grisham novel in years. I was really into his novels when I was in high school, but to be honest, after high school I kind of lost interest. I think the last time I’d read one of his novels was back in the early 2000s when I still lived in Texas.</p>
<p>The book was all right, but it wasn’t the type of story I’m used to from John Grisham. I’m used to his books being more like The Pelican Brief and A Time to Kill. This one wasn’t so much like that and I guess I was just expecting another lawyer making a name for him/herself because he/she took on a case that was making big headlines.</p>
<p>The book was well written, although you might have to get a notepad to keep track of changing names and what’s going on with each person’s family because it can get a bit on the complicated side. I don’t think this book had quite as much character development as previous novels and to be honest, I think that was part of why I didn’t like it. It just didn’t have that John Grisham feel.</p>
<p>All in all, it was a good book but not one I’d really recommend to long time fans of John Grisham.</p></article></li>
