<p class="review__description"><b>Perfect for fans of Sandra Brown and Iris Johannsen.</b></p>
<p>In 1945, an Austrian girl discovers a priceless Nazi treasure near a remote alpine lake and sets in motion a decades-old secret that will change lives for generations to come.</p>
 <p>Many years later, classical pianist Maggie O'Shea is preparing her return to the world of music. Instead, a nightmare of a haunting rhapsody and hundreds of roses from a deranged stalker propel her into a world of terror. Forces drive her to revisit the mystery of her mother's death, her father's startling disappearance, and a terrible secret from World War II. Maggie finds herself on a collision course with a brutal, disfigured killer who threatens those she holds dear—an aging pianist with a long-buried secret, a haunted cellist, a charismatic Maestro, and the crusty retired colonel she has come to love.</p>
 <p>Chord by chord, Rachmaninoff's Rhapsody becomes the heart of this story of profound loss, courage and love. Music tells our stories ...</p>

<blockquote>I received a copy of this book free from Edelweiss+ to facilitate my review. All opinions given are 100% my own.</blockquote>
<p>I wanted to like Dark Rhapsody – and I did… at first. But then, I just lost interest. It wasn’t that it switched between character points of view because that’s normal and I don’t have a problem with it. It also wasn’t that the book was lacking in action, because the book isn’t. It’s got plenty of intrigue, plenty of action, and plenty that should have kept me interested. But… I just wasn’t.</p>
<p>The book itself is great. I cannot deny that the book, up to where I left off, was great. It was just that for some reason, I lost interest in the book. Perhaps it is my overwhelming NetGalley TBR pile that I keep adding books to because I’m being requested to. Perhaps it is because I have a TBR pile a mile high of eBooks that I own. Or perhaps right now just isn’t the time for me to finish this book.</p>
<p>I’ll definitely be getting my own copy of this book – and looking to see if there is a book that goes before it, as it seems as though this is a sequel to some other book. Perhaps that is part of my problem as well. I don’t care to read books out of series, so perhaps I just need to get the previous book(s). I <b>do</b> recommend this book, I just couldn’t seem to finish it at the moment.</p></article></li>

<p class="review__description">Is love worth betraying everything? Plunge into the second adventure in the internationally bestselling Mortal Instruments series and “prepare to be hooked” (<i>Entertainment Weekly</i>)..</p>
<p>Clary Fray just wishes that her life would go back to normal. But what's normal when you're a demon-slaying Shadowhunter, your mother is in a magically induced coma, and you can suddenly see Downworlders like werewolves, vampires, and faeries? If Clary left the world of the Shadowhunters behind, it would mean more time with her best friend, Simon, who's becoming more than a friend. But the Shadowhunting world isn't ready to let her go -- especially her handsome, infuriating, newfound brother, Jace. And Clary's only chance to help her mother is to track down rogue Shadowhunter Valentine, who is probably insane, certainly evil—and also her father.</p>
<p>To complicate matters, someone in New York City is murdering Downworlder children. Is Valentine behind the killings—and if he is, what is he trying to do? When the second of the Mortal Instruments, the Soul-Sword, is stolen, the terrifying Inquisitor arrives to investigate and zooms right in on Jace. How can Clary stop Valentine if Jace is willing to betray everything he believes in to help their father?</p>
<p>In this breathtaking sequel to <i>City of Bones</i>, Cassandra Clare lures her readers back into the dark grip of New York City's Downworld, where love is never safe and power becomes the deadliest temptation.</p>
</section>
<p>The sequel to <i>City of Bones, City of Ashes</i> is no less addicting and action packed than it’s predecessor. Just like <i>City of Bones</i>, I didn’t want to put the book down. Lately, that seems like a near impossibility for me.</p>
<p>I realized after perusing the library’s website that there are actually six books in The Mortal Instruments series as opposed to five. For some reason I managed to miss the fact that a sixth book came out entirely. That just makes me even happier because I don’t want this story to end!</p>
<p>I’ve come to absolutely adore Jace and Clary but I’m still not sure if I really like Isabelle all that much. Alec is growing on me and while I know part of his story because of all the Tumblr posts about the Shadowhunters TV series, I can’t wait to see how it plays out in the books. Luke is another favorite character. And while I hated The Inquisitor, I was sad to see how her portion of the story ended.</p>
<p>I can’t wait for the third book to become available again – I had to turn in books 3-5 because they were due and had holds on them. I’ve got holds on all four of the remaining books and I can’t wait to get my hands on them!</p></article></li>

<p class="review__description">Don’t miss <i>Shadowhunters: The Mortal Instruments</i>, soon to be an Freeform original series. Discover the world it was based on in the first installment of the internationally bestselling Mortal Instruments series and “prepare to be hooked” (<i>Entertainment Weekly</i>).</p>
<p>Enter the world of the Shadowhunters in this special edition of the New York Times bestselling <i>City of Bones</i>, complete with gorgeous cover art from the upcoming Freeform Original Series, <i>Shadowhunters</i>.</p>
<p>When Clary Fray heads out to the Pandemonium Club in New York City, she hardly expects to witness a murder—much less a murder committed by three teenagers covered with strange tattoos and brandishing bizarre weapons. And she’s more than a little startled when the body disappears into thin air. Soon Clary is introduced to the world of the Shadowhunters, a secret cadre of warriors dedicated to driving demons out of our world and back to their own. And Clary is introduced with a vengeance, when her mother disappears and Clary herself is almost killed by a grotesque monster. How could a mere human survive such an attack and kill a demon? The Shadowhunters would like to know…</p>
</section>
<p>I’ve been dying to get my hands on this series for a LONG time, so when I saw all five were available at my local library, I pounced. I read City of Bones in 2 days, which is pretty fast for me with a book that is 485 pages.</p>
<p>This book was definitely worth the hype I’d seen for it. It’s amazing! And the Shadowhunters TV series? Doesn’t do the book justice. In fact, I didn’t like the TV series (I know, blasphemy) so I was sincerely hoping the books would be far better. I wasn’t disappointed.</p>
<p>I love Clary & Jace… not fond of Isabelle or Alec. I’d like to take Valentine out and just… well… get rid of him because he’s such a royal pain as a bad guy. But then again, if I didn’t want to get rid of him, he wouldn’t be a very good bad guy now would he? Simon’s a pretty cool character as well. I love how he feels about Clary although sometimes the way he treats her just sucks.</p>
<p>I can’t wait to delve into the other books – I just hope I can read them all before I have to take them back!</p></article></li>

<p class="review__description"><b>Now in mass market paperback, discover a high stakes world with unexpected and sinister twists that's "visual, kinetic, and furiously paced" from Marie Lu, #1 New York Times bestselling author of the Legend series</b></p>
<p>For the millions who log in every day, Warcross isn't just a game--it's a way of life. Struggling to make ends meet, teenage hacker Emika Chen works as a bounty hunter, tracking down players who bet on the game illegally. Needing to make some quick cash, Emika takes a risk and hacks into the opening game of the international Warcross Championships--only to accidentally glitch herself into the action and become an overnight sensation. Convinced she's going to be arrested, Emika is shocked when instead she gets a call from the game's creator, the elusive young billionaire Hideo Tanaka, with an irresistible offer. With no time to lose, Emika's whisked off to Tokyo and thrust into a world of fame and fortune that she's only dreamed of. But soon her investigation uncovers a sinister plot, with major consequences for the entire Warcross empire.</p>

<p>I’d been wanting to read Warcross by Marie Lu since I’d heard it was coming out. I’d tried for it on NetGalley but was turned down – probably due to my seriously ridiculous backlog there. So when I finally found it here in the library, I snapped it up.</p>
<p>The book was well hyped before it came out and so many readers had said it was so good that I expected my mind to be blown. Instead, while it was most definitely good enough to earn it a 4 star review, it wasn’t the mind-blowing experience I’d expected from the hype. In fact, I found it all to easy to put the book down and not pick it up.</p>
<p>The game of Warcross just wasn’t interesting to me, and I found myself putting the book down for a bit whenever a game was described. I was much more interested in figuring out who Zero was – and unfortunately, it wasn’t too difficult to figure it out. Honestly, I’d have waited until Wildcard, the second book in the series to actually reveal who Zero is… even if it was just in the beginning of the new book.</p>
<p>That being said, the book was very well written and I am looking forward to Wildcard being released. I’m hoping to be able to read a copy as soon as the library gets it because the story is an addicting one outside the descriptions of the Warcross games.</p></article></li>

<p class="review__description"><b>The #1 New York Times bestseller!</b></p>
<p><b>Now a Hulu original series starring Reese Witherspoon and Kerry Washington. "I read Little Fires Everywhere in a single, breathless sitting." --Jodi Picoult<br>
"To say I love this book is an understatement. It's a deep psychological mystery about the power of motherhood, the intensity of teenage love, and the danger of perfection. It moved me to tears." --Reese Witherspoon<br>
"Extraordinary . . . books like Little Fires Everywhere don't come along often." --John Green</b></p>
 <p>From the bestselling author of Everything I Never Told You, a riveting novel that traces the intertwined fates of the picture-perfect Richardson family and the enigmatic mother and daughter who upend their lives.</p>
 <p>n Shaker Heights, a placid, progressive suburb of Cleveland, everything is planned--from the layout of the winding roads, to the colors of the houses, to the successful lives its residents will go on to lead. And no one embodies this spirit more than Elena Richardson, whose guiding principle is playing by the rules.</p>
 <p>Enter Mia Warren--an enigmatic artist and single mother--who arrives in this idyllic bubble with her teenaged daughter Pearl, and rents a house from the Richardsons. Soon Mia and Pearl become more than tenants: all four Richardson children are drawn to the mother-daughter pair. But Mia carries with her a mysterious past and a disregard for the status quo that threatens to upend this carefully ordered community.</p>
 <p>When old family friends of the Richardsons attempt to adopt a Chinese-American baby, a custody battle erupts that dramatically divides the town--and puts Mia and Elena on opposing sides. Suspicious of Mia and her motives, Elena is determined to uncover the secrets in Mia's past. But her obsession will come at unexpected and devastating costs.
Little Fires Everywhere explores the weight of secrets, the nature of art and identity, and the ferocious pull of motherhood--and the danger of believing that following the rules can avert disaster.</p>

<p>I’m still trying to figure out exactly how I feel about this book. I mean, I rated it 4 stars, so I obviously I liked it, but I’m still not quite sure how I feel about the book.</p>
<p>Little Fires Everywhere is a wonderful novel. I’m not going to say it isn’t. It’s thought provoking. It will make you laugh, it will make you cry, it will make you angry. You’ll find yourself taking sides on issues raised in the book. You’ll find yourself heartbroken for characters who have lost something. You’ll find yourself hoping that characters get what they are looking for in the end.</p>
<p>I went out of my genre comfort zone for this book. I don’t normally read books that are in the “Fiction” or “Adult Fiction” category unless I’ve been seeing them everywhere – which I’ve been seeing a lot of people talking about this book. I’ve seen where people say it’s slow moving, which I suppose you could say that it is, but I read it in 2 days, so it can’t be that slow moving. Usually when I think of a slow moving book, it takes me over a week to read the book because it moves so slowly that I can’t get into it. I think it is more a matter of the book moves slowly if you simply aren’t interested in it.</p>
<p>I fell in love with the kids in this book – Pearl and Izzy especially. I keep wondering if Trip & Moody really are named that or if they are nicknames for which we simply are never given their proper given names. The kids are just so genuine and I know how Izzy feels because I’ve felt that way on more than one occasion with my family (although in my case it is extended family who make me feel that way, not my parents).</p>
<p>The May Ling Chow/Mirabelle McCullough story line tugged at my heart. I can totally see how both sides felt, but I must admit, I sided with Bebe Chow. You’ll have to tell me which side you chose in that debate.</p>
<p>All in all, the book is a really good read and I do recommend that you check it out if you’re into adult fiction.</p></article></li>
