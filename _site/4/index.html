<p class="review__description"><i>“Boogity, boogity, boogity! Let’s go racing!”</i></p>
<p>Winning is in every racer’s blood. They continually push themselves to the edge, physically and emotionally, in pursuit of the checkered flag and a visit to Victory Lane. It is the racer’s way.</p>
<p>We too are racers in the middle of the greatest race known to mankind: life. We want to live in a way that, when we reach our finish line, we can be proud of what we’ve accomplished. We want to be an example for our family and friends. And if we are a follower of Christ, we want to hear the words “well done my good and faithful servant.”</p>
<p>In The Race, Motor Racing Outreach leaders Billy Mauldin and Kyle Froman share the lessons they’ve learned in the pits and among the NASCAR community to help others with their personal mission—preparing for it, receiving it, and then living faithfully on mission.</p>
<p>Throughout, three-time NASCAR champion and Hall of Fame inductee Darrell Waltrip offers related stories on what it takes to win the race, giving fans an inside look at his profession and the personal belief in God that keeps him on mission.</p>

<p>I’ve been a NASCAR fan for quite a while so I know who Darrell Waltrip is. And I’ll admit, I thought this book was going to be more about racing than about being a Christian. I suppose I should have expected the Christianity bit by the publisher, but I wasn’t paying attention when I picked it.</p>
<p>The book is surprisingly good and shows how you can live a life on the road, working every Sunday, and still keep and spread your Christian faith. While Darrell doesn’t so much talk about how he’s shared his faith–he talks more about how he kept it than how he’s shared it–Kyle Froman and Billy Mauldin talk about sharing faith as chaplains for MRO (Motor Racing Outreach).</p>
<p>The Race brings a new perspective to Christianity. It brings the perspective of people who know that it is a struggle to be a Christian in our world and what kind of struggles one might have based on the profession he or she has chosen. It is clear to see that the message is that we can still be Christians regardless of what we choose to do with our lives and we can still be shining lights for others at the same time.</p></article></li>

<p class="review__description">Could you be the answer to the problems you see?   Every day we are faced with the needs of those around us. Emotional. Physical. Spiritual. What are we to do about it? Are these problems for our pastors to address or is there a way for the church member to make an impact that will last?   Bestselling author Thom S. Rainer answers these questions by offering nine simple traits that you can incorporate into your life no matter your background, stage of life, or sense of capability. You can do it. Now it's time to just stand up and say you will!</p>

<p>This book will definitely step on some readers’ toes. I’ve always heard that a good sermon or a good book on how to be a proper Christian will step on your toes. That’s not always a good thing. In the case of I Will, it is.</p>
<p>Too many times Christians (and non-Christians as well) focus too much on themselves. What they want. What they feel they need. How they think the church and other people in it should act. I fully admit even as a non-Christian that I have a specific idea of how a church I attend should handle their affairs. I have a specific idea of how the music should be, how the preacher should preach, how the congregation should act. And that’s not OK.</p>
<p>I Will is about changing the attitude of church members from being focused on themselves, what they want, what they feel they need, and putting that focus on others. Serving others. Becoming involved in the church not because you “have to” but because you desire to.</p>
<p>Your toes will be stepped on if you exhibit any of the “bad” behaviors in this book. But if you take the time to read and learn, you will grow and leave those behaviors behind.</p></article></li>

<p class="review__description">No one wants to see a church die. And yet, far too many churches are dying. For more than twenty-five years, Dr. Thom Rainer has helped churches grow, reverse the trends of decline, and has autopsied those that have died. From this experience, he has discovered twelve consistent themes among those churches that have died. Yet, it's not gloom and doom because from those twelve themes, lessons on how to keep your church alive have emerged.
Whether your church is vibrant or dying, whether you are a pastor or a church member, Autopsy of a Deceased Church will walk you through the radical paths necessary to keep your church alive to the glory of God and advancement of Christ's Kingdom!</p>

<blockquote>I received this book for free from NetGalley in exchange for an honest review. This does not affect my opinion of the book or the content of my review.</blockquote>
<p>I found this book to be quite interesting and eye opening.  I’d always wondered what could possibly cause a particular church location to shut its doors and now I have a fairly good idea of what those reasons are.</p>
<p>Rainer doesn’t sugar coat the truth about why churches die. While to someone who might be a member of a dying church might see this as Rainer being a jerk, he really isn’t. He’s telling it like it is – this is a fairly apt description of what is killing your church and here are some ways you can fix it.</p>
<p>I like that the book doesn’t just cover what’s wrong with a dying church but also gives ways in which it can be fixed–or in the case of a church that is clearly dying and unable to be turned around, how it can die with dignity. I’ll admit some of the suggestions made me curious–especially the ones for how to allow your church to die with dignity–because in all honesty, I see some of the signs of a church that is becoming ill in the church my roommates attend.</p>
<p>I definitely recommend this book for anyone who feels their church may be on the path to death. This book is a great tool for pastors and congregations to help determine what stage a church is in and how to reverse it if possible.</p></article></li>
