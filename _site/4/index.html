<p class="review__description"><b>The True Story Behind the Powerful Film ALL SAINTS</b></p>
<p>Newly ordained, Michael Spurlock's first assignment is to pastor All Saints, a struggling church with twenty-five devoted members and a mortgage well beyond its means. The best option may be to close the church rather than watch it wither any further. But when All Saints hesitantly risks welcoming a community of Karen refugees from Burma--former farmers scrambling for a fresh start in America--Michael feels they may be called to an improbable new mission.</p>
<p>Michael must choose between closing the church and selling the property--or listening to a still, small voice challenging the people of All Saints to risk it all and provide much-needed hope to their new community. Together, they risk everything to plant seeds for a future that might just save them all.</p>
<p>Discover the true story that inspired the film while also diving deeper into the background of the Karen people, the church, and how a community of believers rally to reach out to those in need, yet receive far more than they dared imagine.</p>
<p>The <b>Reverend Michael Spurlock</b> served All Saints Episcopal Church in Smyrna, Tennessee, for three years. He is currently on the clergy staff at Saint Thomas Church Fifth Avenue in New York City. Michael, his wife, Aimee, and their two children live in New York City.</p>
<p>Award-winning author and investigative journalist Jeanette Windle has lived in six countries, authored nineteen books, and mentors writers on five continents. To learn more, visit her at www.jeanettewindle.com.</p>

<p>Imagine being called to lead a church with issues. Dire financial issues, a recent split in the congregation, and a congregation that needs to heal from said split. Now imagine that you’ve been called to lead this church as your very first assignment out of seminary. That’s what Reverend Michael Spurlock faced when he was called to lead All Saints Episcopal Church in Smyrna, TN.</p>
<p>This book was nothing short of amazing to be perfectly honest. The telling of the backstories, which was essential to understanding what was happening with Rev. Spurlock, Ye Win, and other major players in the book, worked very well. I will say that I had hoped to learn more about All Saints’ split that happened just prior to Rev. Spurlock taking over, but that probably wasn’t something that was necessary to the story and was more to satisfy my own curiosity about the matter.</p>
<p>This book shows what it is to do as God and Christ command and love our neighbors as we love ourselves. Trust me when I say that by human standards, Rev. Spurlock would have been more than justified in telling the Burmese refugees that All Saints couldn’t help them and that they needed to find somewhere else to go. But he didn’t. He recalled scripture, when Christ said that if someone has done something for the least of these, they’ve done it for Christ. And to Rev. Spurlock’s surprise, those refugees helped All Saints as much as All Saints helped them.</p>
<p>This book is a great read that can be accomplished in about a day or so – at least that’s how long it took me to read it. It was very well written, easy to follow, and gives you a great glimpse into the world of the refugees so you can understand how they felt and where they came from. This book would make an excellent choice for a Christian book club to read and discuss. I gave it 4 stars and I have to say, I’m going to have to see that movie now.</p></article></li>

<p class="review__description"><i>I am my beloved's and my beloved is mine.... --from the Song of Songs</i></p>
<p>Did you know that God loves you with a passion--and He wrote a love song to help you experience that love in a personal way?</p>
<p>Tucked away in the pages of Scripture is one of the most fascinating and most misunderstood books of the Bible: the Song of Songs. Although the Song of Songs details a passionate, earthly love story, it is intended to illuminate the best love story, the intense love God has for us, His beloved.</p>
<p>n He Calls You Beautiful, Bible teacher Dee Brestin explores this love song from God to reveal transformative truths for each of us, whether married, single, or widowed. With rich contemporary illustrations and insight from biblical scholars, Dee shows how God uses poetry and exquisite images to illuminate the intimacy that Jesus longs to have with you.</p>
<p>God calls you to know His love not only in your head but also in your heart. He sings over you a song of love, a song of salvation, a song of hope. A Song of songs.</p>
<p>Includes an in-depth Bible study for use individually or in a group setting.</p>

<p>I’m generally looking for new Bible study books and when given the chance to review <i>He Calls You Beautiful</i> I thought I’d hit the jackpot. Finally, someone could explain to me why in the world Song of Songs (Song of Solomon in some Bibles) was even included in the Bible, because it just didn’t seem to fit.</p>
<p>Sadly, I just wasn’t impressed by this book. It was difficult for me to get interested in it. The writing isn’t bad, in fact, the writing is beautifully done. But for some reason the material presented just didn’t resonate with me. Perhaps it is because I’m not in the right time/place in my life, so this isn’t a message that I need to hear?</p>
<p>I love that the book includes Bible study material for both individuals and small groups. The subject matter is such that when I saw that it included Bible study materials, I figured it would be specifically for individuals because, well, the message is to each person <b>individually</b>. The message would seem to be that Heavenly Father and Jesus love <b>you</b>. The message is for <b>you</b>. But, it’s really for everyone because God and Jesus love everyone.</p>
<p>I gave the book 2 stars because it’s not horrible and in all honesty, if I come back to it at another time in my life, it might well work out for me a lot better. Perhaps right now just wasn’t the right time for this message for me.</p></article></li>

<p>I really wanted to read this book. I really wanted to like this book. But after getting a third of the way through the book and still finding that it just didn’t capture or keep my interest, I knew. This book was destined for the abandoned books shelf.</p>
<p>I don’t know if the problem was that I came in on the 3rd book of a series or if the book simply is as dry and boring as I think it is. To be honest, I reached Chapter 11 and felt that the book was just moving at a snail’s pace. Usually the books I read are a touch more fast paced than this or at least they’re interesting enough to keep me going. But several chapters alone were dedicated to Josie and her friends having dinner and talking about the case and that, for me, was just too much time being taken to get things moving.</p>
<p>I did appreciate the fact that even as a new believer, Josie is able to send up heartfelt prayers at pretty much any time she chooses – something I myself still struggle to do. But other than that, I have to say, I just wasn’t into it.</p>
<p>This one gets 0 stars because I abandoned it. I may try to read it again, but it’s unlikely.</p></article></li>

<p class="review__description">Among the many pressing social concerns that have galvanized evangelical Christians’ response—abortion, human trafficking, environmental degradation, and many others—the care of animals has received relatively little attention.</p>
<p>Yet as author Sarah Withrow King deftly uncovers in Vegangelical, animal stewardship is a necessary aspect of a holistic ethic of Christian peace and justice. Indeed, care for animal welfare correspondingly strengthens our care for environmental and human flourishing.</p>
<p>Practical, restrained in its conclusions, and grounded on a broader theology of Christian compassion, Vegangelical calls readers to a greater attentiveness to one of the primary relationships in God’s created order, that between humans and animals.</p>

<p>As a vegetarian Christian who struggles daily with whether or not it is all right from a faith perspective to even be a vegetarian. I’ve had Romans 14:2 KJV “For one believeth that he may eat all things: another, who is weak, eateth herbs” used against me as a reason not to be vegetarian. So you can imagine my surprise to see a book that actually uses research into Biblical principles for not only being vegetarian but being vegan.</p>
<p>Sarah Withrow King holds a Masters’ Degree in Theology, so the theological and Biblical research in this book is sound. It makes sense. God created the creatures and commanded us to be good stewards of our planet and His other creatures. She even takes on the tricky question of whether or not Jesus ate fish (or other animals for that matter).</p>
<p>While she makes several good points regarding the reasons in which from a faith standpoint it not only is appropriate to be vegetarian or vegan, but also that it can grow your faith, Mrs. King does take the time to do a bit of animal activism in there as well. Yes, she does use it to drive home the point about the Biblical commands from God about being a good steward of His world, but much of it does actually remind me a lot of what I see/hear from PETA (for whom the author used to work).</p>
<p>The book is very interesting and easy to follow, although I fear that for Christians who are currently meat-eaters, it may be quite off-putting because it will step on their toes quite a bit. But the fact of the matter is, it is a great read for those of use who don’t consume meat and are wondering if it truly is all right for a Christian to be vegetarian/vegan after God said we could eat animals for food. There’s a great commentary on that scripture from Genesis in this book as well.</p>
<p>I give this one a solid 4 stars, only because the reading could get a bit on the dry side at times.</p></article></li>

<p class="review__description">Passion that takes no prisoners, and love that tests the limits of ecstasy . . .
Fenn Lockwood comes alive in the shadows. Though he might have physically survived the kidnapping that stole his childhood, the trauma and pain he lived through have marked him forever. Now the only place where Fenn can be himself is within the walls of his private BDSM world-a place of erotic obsession, where desire isn't just captured . . . it's bound.</p>
<p>Hayden Thorne knows that behind Fenn's hardened exterior is a man worth fighting for. Yet to save him from the past that still haunts him, Hayden will have to abandon every inhibition she's ever had and venture into Fenn's intoxicatingly sensual world. Each tantalizing second she spends in Fenn's searing embrace is more delicious than the last and soon Hayden begins to think that she may never want to leave such torturous bliss . . .</p>

<p>It took me a bit to get into this one, but once I did, I was hooked. I admit, I have a BDSM fetish when I read–if the fan fiction I tend to read is any indication–so any book that includes that is generally a winner with me. I have to say though, this is the first time I’ve actually liked any of the erotica novels I’ve tried reading.</p>
<p>I usually find romance/erotica novels to be poorly written and laughable with what the characters are trying to do in the bedroom, but I definitely didn’t find that issue in this novel. Plus, most romance/erotica novels have little in the way of actual story other than the copious amounts of sex that are featured. This book actually has a story that goes with it and it’s an intriguing one at that.</p>
<p>Yes, this is the second in a series, but you don’t need to read the first book, The Gilded Cuff, to understand what is going on or enjoy this book. The story line is a great one and it stands on its own very well. I have to say that I do want to read The Gilded Cuff and the story that comes after this one, The Gilded Chain, because if I enjoyed The Gilded Cage this much, I’m sure to enjoy those as well.</p></article></li>
