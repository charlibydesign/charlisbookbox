<p>If anyone thinks this book is *just* for home schooled children, they’d be wrong. This book is actually good for any teen, and even good for some adults to be honest. The fact the Tim Tebow was home schooled is most likely the reason behind him determining the book would be for home schooled kids.</p>
<p>This book gives 36 helpful weekly lessons on figuring out who you are and how following the Lord can make your life better. Each lesson comes with a writing exercise to encourage the reader to think about the lesson that was provided. While I read the book in 2 days because I wasn’t following the lesson plan, I would be more than willing to go back through the book and do the writing exercises.</p>
<p>36 weeks is equal to approximately one school year, so parents can use this book during their curriculum if they home school or just as a weekly study for their kids in general. I think this book is an excellent tool for helping kids find their faith and figure out who they are in Christ.</p>
<p>I also think that new Christians might benefit from this book, even though it is geared towards teens. It can be hard to figure out who you are in Christ at any age, especially if you’ve grown up in a family where faith is not a big part of your life.</p>
<p>Tim gives good, solid accounts of when he was a child/teen and how situations were handled. He admits he made and makes mistakes, something that it is good for anyone to see – that nobody is perfect.</p>
<p>This was a solid 4 star read and I have to say, I’ll probably be going back through the book and doing the writing exercises for myself.</p></article></li>

<p class="review__description">You will be inspired, challenged and encouraged to arise and journey with the Lord as women of the Bible did!</p>
<p>Join Jumoke Akinniranye in exploring the incredible, inspiring lives of many of the women in the Bible. In a time when women are searching for their true identity in God, this book will give you a good insight and understanding of the strength, gifting and weaknesses of these extraordinary women, allowing you to grasp the truth that they were ordinary woman, just like you, who chose to walk in the fullness of God's purpose for their lives.</p>
<p>This book will give you the confidence and assurance you need to boldly journey with the Lord as these women did - despite the challenges they had to confront and overcome. It will also show you how each of them was able to anchor their abilities and gifts to the Lord.</p>
<p>I believe that through this book you will receive a greater revelation of the Father's heart for women, which will help you in your journey with the Lord as you read it.</p>
<p>JUMOKE AKINNIRANYE is an accountant by profession. She was born in the UK and raised in Nigeria, the third child of Christian parents. She had a major encounter with the Lord in April 2009, spanning a continuous nine months, during which she received an unprecedented presence of God and was called into the offices of Apostle and Prophet. Jumoke resides in Hertfordshire, England with her two sons Ore and Seun.</p>

<p>While I was drawn in by the title of this book, I honestly thought I would end up not liking it. After all, I usually get annoyed with non-fiction Christian books for some reason. There always seems to be something that just bugs me about them. Not so much for this one.</p>
<p>Jumoke Akinniranye paints a fuller picture of some of the most prominent women of the Bible, giving insight as to how they might have felt, what the culture of the time was like and how they fit into that culture, and showing what we can learn from them. She even includes women who set bad examples, such as Queen Jezebel – so we can learn from their mistakes.</p>
<p>One of my favorite sections was on Martha and Mary from the New Testament. We all know the story of how Martha got fed up with Mary not helping her with the work that needed to be done while Jesus was visiting and basically asked Him to tell Mary to get up and help her. Then after Lazarus died, when Jesus arrived, she argued with him about various things. In all honesty, I see a lot of Martha in me. I can guarantee you that I wouldn’t shut up and listen, I’d be arguing because I overthink everything.</p>
<p>I must say there was one spot that I was a bit flustered with – the story of Sarah/Sarai. In this section, the author states that nothing is known of Sarah’s lineage, but that’s not actually true. In Genesis 20:12, when Abraham is answering to Abimelek as to why they lied about Sarah being his sister instead of his wife, Abraham answers that she really is his sister – the daughter of his father though not of his mother, who happened to become his wife. So we know that Abraham and Sarah share a father. But this is just something minor in comparison to the lessons this book as for women of faith.</p>
<p>I definitely recommend this book to any woman looking to grow her faith and see how God could use her to serve Him.</p></article></li>

<p class="review__description"><b>The True Story Behind the Powerful Film ALL SAINTS</b></p>
<p>Newly ordained, Michael Spurlock's first assignment is to pastor All Saints, a struggling church with twenty-five devoted members and a mortgage well beyond its means. The best option may be to close the church rather than watch it wither any further. But when All Saints hesitantly risks welcoming a community of Karen refugees from Burma--former farmers scrambling for a fresh start in America--Michael feels they may be called to an improbable new mission.</p>
<p>Michael must choose between closing the church and selling the property--or listening to a still, small voice challenging the people of All Saints to risk it all and provide much-needed hope to their new community. Together, they risk everything to plant seeds for a future that might just save them all.</p>
<p>Discover the true story that inspired the film while also diving deeper into the background of the Karen people, the church, and how a community of believers rally to reach out to those in need, yet receive far more than they dared imagine.</p>
<p>The <b>Reverend Michael Spurlock</b> served All Saints Episcopal Church in Smyrna, Tennessee, for three years. He is currently on the clergy staff at Saint Thomas Church Fifth Avenue in New York City. Michael, his wife, Aimee, and their two children live in New York City.</p>
<p>Award-winning author and investigative journalist Jeanette Windle has lived in six countries, authored nineteen books, and mentors writers on five continents. To learn more, visit her at www.jeanettewindle.com.</p>

<p>Imagine being called to lead a church with issues. Dire financial issues, a recent split in the congregation, and a congregation that needs to heal from said split. Now imagine that you’ve been called to lead this church as your very first assignment out of seminary. That’s what Reverend Michael Spurlock faced when he was called to lead All Saints Episcopal Church in Smyrna, TN.</p>
<p>This book was nothing short of amazing to be perfectly honest. The telling of the backstories, which was essential to understanding what was happening with Rev. Spurlock, Ye Win, and other major players in the book, worked very well. I will say that I had hoped to learn more about All Saints’ split that happened just prior to Rev. Spurlock taking over, but that probably wasn’t something that was necessary to the story and was more to satisfy my own curiosity about the matter.</p>
<p>This book shows what it is to do as God and Christ command and love our neighbors as we love ourselves. Trust me when I say that by human standards, Rev. Spurlock would have been more than justified in telling the Burmese refugees that All Saints couldn’t help them and that they needed to find somewhere else to go. But he didn’t. He recalled scripture, when Christ said that if someone has done something for the least of these, they’ve done it for Christ. And to Rev. Spurlock’s surprise, those refugees helped All Saints as much as All Saints helped them.</p>
<p>This book is a great read that can be accomplished in about a day or so – at least that’s how long it took me to read it. It was very well written, easy to follow, and gives you a great glimpse into the world of the refugees so you can understand how they felt and where they came from. This book would make an excellent choice for a Christian book club to read and discuss. I gave it 4 stars and I have to say, I’m going to have to see that movie now.</p></article></li>

<p class="review__description"><i>I am my beloved's and my beloved is mine.... --from the Song of Songs</i></p>
<p>Did you know that God loves you with a passion--and He wrote a love song to help you experience that love in a personal way?</p>
<p>Tucked away in the pages of Scripture is one of the most fascinating and most misunderstood books of the Bible: the Song of Songs. Although the Song of Songs details a passionate, earthly love story, it is intended to illuminate the best love story, the intense love God has for us, His beloved.</p>
<p>n He Calls You Beautiful, Bible teacher Dee Brestin explores this love song from God to reveal transformative truths for each of us, whether married, single, or widowed. With rich contemporary illustrations and insight from biblical scholars, Dee shows how God uses poetry and exquisite images to illuminate the intimacy that Jesus longs to have with you.</p>
<p>God calls you to know His love not only in your head but also in your heart. He sings over you a song of love, a song of salvation, a song of hope. A Song of songs.</p>
<p>Includes an in-depth Bible study for use individually or in a group setting.</p>

<p>I’m generally looking for new Bible study books and when given the chance to review <i>He Calls You Beautiful</i> I thought I’d hit the jackpot. Finally, someone could explain to me why in the world Song of Songs (Song of Solomon in some Bibles) was even included in the Bible, because it just didn’t seem to fit.</p>
<p>Sadly, I just wasn’t impressed by this book. It was difficult for me to get interested in it. The writing isn’t bad, in fact, the writing is beautifully done. But for some reason the material presented just didn’t resonate with me. Perhaps it is because I’m not in the right time/place in my life, so this isn’t a message that I need to hear?</p>
<p>I love that the book includes Bible study material for both individuals and small groups. The subject matter is such that when I saw that it included Bible study materials, I figured it would be specifically for individuals because, well, the message is to each person <b>individually</b>. The message would seem to be that Heavenly Father and Jesus love <b>you</b>. The message is for <b>you</b>. But, it’s really for everyone because God and Jesus love everyone.</p>
<p>I gave the book 2 stars because it’s not horrible and in all honesty, if I come back to it at another time in my life, it might well work out for me a lot better. Perhaps right now just wasn’t the right time for this message for me.</p></article></li>

<blockquote>I received this book for free from NetGalley in exchange for an honest review. This does not affect my opinion of the book or the content of my review.</blockquote>
<p>I really wanted to read this book. I really wanted to like this book. But after getting a third of the way through the book and still finding that it just didn’t capture or keep my interest, I knew. This book was destined for the abandoned books shelf.</p>
<p>I don’t know if the problem was that I came in on the 3rd book of a series or if the book simply is as dry and boring as I think it is. To be honest, I reached Chapter 11 and felt that the book was just moving at a snail’s pace. Usually the books I read are a touch more fast paced than this or at least they’re interesting enough to keep me going. But several chapters alone were dedicated to Josie and her friends having dinner and talking about the case and that, for me, was just too much time being taken to get things moving.</p>
<p>I did appreciate the fact that even as a new believer, Josie is able to send up heartfelt prayers at pretty much any time she chooses – something I myself still struggle to do. But other than that, I have to say, I just wasn’t into it.</p>
<p>This one gets 0 stars because I abandoned it. I may try to read it again, but it’s unlikely.</p></article></li>
