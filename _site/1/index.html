<p class="review__description">The best things in life are crazy... Sara is obsessed with rock star Tyler Vincent, and as she works to complete her senior year, she's determined to find a way to meet him-although her best friend, Aimee, keeps telling her to find a different escape from her desperately violent home life. Complications arise when Dale, the mysterious new transfer student, sets his sights on Sara, and she falls for this rock-star-in-the-making in spite of her better judgment. When Sara wins a contest, she is faced with a choice-travel to Tyler Vincent's home town to meet him, or stay and support Dale in a Battle-of-the-Bands hosted by MTV. Their triangulated relationship is pushed to its breaking point, but there is another, deeper secret Dale's been keeping that just may break things wide open... <i>Turn up your collar, feather your hair, and splash on some Polo, because we're going back to the '80's when MTV played music videos, there was no such thing as American Idol, and becoming a star meant doing nothing short of crazy for that one, big break.</i></p>

<p>CW: Sex</p>
<p>If you’re a teenager looking for a new book about teen angst and relationships, don’t bother with this one. Yes, I know the description reads like a really cool YA novel that is set in the 1980s. But it’s not. Trust me. There’s a warning that I found at the very end of the book that should have been at the beginning – this book is for purchase/reading by adults only. There’s a very good reason for that.</p>
<p>For one thing, although it does take a bit to get to it, there are some explicit sex scenes in the book. Not enough to make me say the novel is exactly erotica – most erotica novels I’ve read don’t have a plot other than having sex – but enough to know that this book isn’t for anyone who isn’t an adult. Another thing that made me realize this book was not for teens but for adults were the themes of domestic violence, marital infidelity, and even eating disorders that come up in the book. This book has a plot and “smut” isn’t it.</p>
<p>I found Sara to be a sweet, lovable character who is simply caught in a horrible situation. Because of this, she’s become obsessed with Tyler Vincent, a rock star &amp; actor. She writes him “letters” which are never sent, just kept in a notebook because they are more or less her diary. Sara’s best friend Aimee is also sweet, lovable, and has her own issues to work through – some of which we see in the book. After seeing a glimpse of Aimee’s story in the book, I’d actually like to see a sequel of sorts to this one that explores more of Aimee’s story, just because. Dale is the kind of guy I’d love to have around. He cares more for Sara than you’d think he would and given what you’ll find out as the book goes on, he’s extremely tolerant of Sara’s obsession with Tyler Vincent.</p>
<p>This book was extremely well written. I had to look up a few things to make sure they’d have been in use in the 80s because there were a couple of things I thought were too modern – but I was wrong, they were in use back then, I just didn’t remember them. If there were any spelling or grammar errors, I missed them because I was too busy paying attention to the story itself.</p>
<p>I gave this one 4 stars because it’s a very well written book, but I wasn’t expecting the type of book I got based on the description and synopsis.</p></article></li>

<p class="review__description">Ever since her best friend Anna died, Evie has been an outcast in her small fishing town. Hiding her talents, mourning her loss, drowning in her guilt. Then a girl with an uncanny resemblance to Anna appears on the shore, and the two girls catch the eyes of two charming princes. Suddenly Evie feels like she might finally have a chance at her own happily ever after. But magic isn't kind, and her new friend harbors secrets of her own. She can't stay in Havnestad - or on two legs - without Evie's help. And when Evie reaches deep into the power of her magic to save her friend's humanity - and her prince's heart - she discovers, too late, what she's bargained away.</p>

<p>If you’ve ever seen <i>The Little Mermaid</i>, and you’ve ever wondered how Ursula came to be who she is, this is the book for you. Trust me.</p>
<p>I’ve long been a fan of <i>The Little Mermaid</i>, but it never occurred to me that perhaps the sea witch wasn’t always that way. A half human/half octopus I mean. Not evil. I just assumed she’d always been evil. It never occurred to me that the sea witch might have a back story. So Sea Witch was the back story I didn’t know I needed.</p>
<p>What happens when you have a mermaid bent on revenge, a witch who has to hide her magic from everyone – including her best friend, and a prince who loves one but not the other? A story that needs to be told, that’s what!</p>
<p>I loved the idea that <i>The Little Mermaid‘s</i> Sea Witch had a back story. I love books like this – where a particular character, especially the villian – gets a back story so we know what happened to make them a villian. So we can see that these bad guys weren’t always bad guys. Something happened to make them that way.</p>
<p><i>Sea Witch</i> is Sarah Henning’s debut novel and I have to say, she knocked this one out of the park. This book is seriously one of the best back story novels I’ve read. The characters are likeable and perfect for the story.</p>
<p>Nik – the prince and Evie’s best friend, he makes for the perfect hero in this story.<br>
Evie – a witch who can’t let anyone know she’s a witch, Nik’s best friend. Her story is a sad one.<br>
Anna – Evie &amp; Nik’s other best friend, sadly she’s not around for most of the book… or is she?<br>
Annemette – the mermaid (you knew there had to be one here, right?) who tries to capture her true love’s heart.</p>
<p>By the time all the twists have played out, you’ll understand why the Sea Witch is who she is. This one got 5 out of 5 stars for me because this is an amazing debut novel and I can’t wait to see what Sarah Henning comes up with next.</p></article></li>

<p class="review__description">With Laura J. Burns and Melinda Metz's signature plot twists, and uneasy, ever-changing alliances,<i>I Do Not Trust You</i> is a thrilling journey at every turn that asks—what would you do to save the ones you love?</p>
<p>Memphis "M" Engel is stubborn to a fault, graced with an almost absurd knowledge of long lost languages and cultures, and a heck of an opponent in a fight. In short: she's awesome.</p>
 <p>Ashwin “Ash” Sood is a little too posh for M's tastes, a little too good looking, and has way too many secrets. He desperately wants the ancient map M inherited from her archeologist father, believing it will lead him to a relic with the power to destroy the world. M obviously can't trust him.</p>
 <p>Equally desperate to find the relic for reasons of her own, M forms an uneasy partnership with Ash. From the catacombs of Paris, to a sacred forest in Norway, to the ruins of a submerged temple in Egypt, together they crisscross the globe in their search. But through it all, M can never be sure: Is she traveling with a friend or enemy?</p>

<p>When I was asked to review <i>I Do Not Trust You</i>, I was a bit on the skeptical side. I’ve been having some issues with books that have multiple authors lately – for some reason I just can’t seem to get into them or if I do get into them, I can’t seem to stay interested in them. But this one? This one was awesome!</p>
<p>Laura J. Burns &amp; Melinda Metz have teamed up before – in fact, one of their previous novels, <i>Sanctuary Bay</i>, is in my TBR pile at this very moment, and might very well be my next read.  That alone should have told me that this book would be a winner – because author teams generally don’t end up writing more books together unless the previous ones are great.</p>
<p>I love the characters – Memphis (M) and Ashwin (Ash) at least. I’m rather fond of Mike as well and let me tell you, I was as surprised as Ash was when we finally got to meet Mike in person. I definitely wasn’t expecting that! The other characters, such as Phillip, Bob, and Liza definitely aren’t my favorites but then again, they’re not meant to be the readers’ favorite characters. They’re obnoxious and downright evil in some cases.</p>
<p>I loved the use of the Egyptian mythology as honestly, I love Egyptian mythology – the book actually made me want to brush up on it because it’s been a while since I’ve been able to read up on any of it. I Do Not Trust You is action packed even if it doesn’t seem like it would be – believe me, it is.  It’s difficult to put down once you start reading and frankly, I had to force myself to put it down to do things like eat, sleep, and housework. As for the ending – you will be so amazed!!</p>
<p>This book was so well written and so well edited that I have to give it 5 stars. It’s a great book – funny at times, heart-pounding at times, and just absolutely awesome. You won’t regret reading this one.</p></article></li>

<p class="review__description">Giuseppe Cafiero presents the most intriguing biography of one of America's most enduring writers: poet, author, and critic Edgar Allan Poe. The beloved master of mystery and the macabre, Poe's life and work are explored through the creation of memories, recriminations, intense loves and of delicate devotions.
Using the form of literary nonfiction, Cafiero successfully structures this memoir in the style of a traditional fiction narrative. Introducing the reader to the character, The Reporter, whose story is a mirror in which it's possible to contemplate what is unreasonably hidden and infinitely ambiguous in the existence and in the writing of Edgar Allan Poe.</p>
<p>After Poe's infamous death, the reporter attempts to investigate the life and writing of Poe by attending a meeting at the Old Swan Tavern in Richmond. Invited to the interview is archrival Reverend Rufus Wilmot Griswold and one of the last to see Poe before his death, Dr. J. Evans Snodgrass. The reporter not only discovers the accusations of life filled with alcoholism, opium addiction, violence and womanizing but also begins to understand that this painful dark existence is not the antithesis to great writing. This is confirmed when the investigation continues with the meeting of an array of people by the reporter who divulges more information on the life of Poe and why many became the protagonists in his stories.</p>
 <p>This surreal bio-fiction of the life of nineteenth-century American writer, father of detective fiction, Edgar Allan Poe, brings to life a solidly constructed psychological portrait of the writer through the characters in his works. Each of the stories is accompanied by the gloriously gothic Illustrations by acclaimed Italian artist Sergio Poddighe.
Perhaps this is the only way to pay tribute to a writer who has indelibly marked the nineteenth-century.</p>

<blockquote>I received a copy of this book free from NetGalley to facilitate my review. All opinions given are 100% my own.</blockquote>
<p>I put this book as a DNF because I abandoned it, but honestly, the book was horrible. The book reads like a grade school essay. It’s disjointed, disconnected, and nearly impossible to make sense of.
</p>
<p>I requested to read this book because I love Edgar Allan Poe. I thought this was supposed to be some sort of biography of Edgar Allan Poe. Instead what I got was a mishmash of nonsense that related to his life but made no sense.</p>
<p>The author jumps around from person to person who supposedly knew Poe, trying to gather pieces of his life in what I assume is an attempt to make a timeline of his life and possibly to figure out why he wrote what he did. The problem is, none of it makes a bit of sense. While this may be due in part to the book having been translated to English from another language, I honestly cannot recommend this book to anyone.</p></article></li>

<p class="review__description">The man had seemed so innocent in the bar—okay, not innocent, per se. He’d been hot, hard, and possessed a butt that I wanted to bite like the last chocolate chip cookie in my stash. </p>
<p>He’d also skipped out of town faster than a villain in a B movie, leaving me woefully unsatisfied. I’d chalked the whole incident up to a bad night stand and moved on with my life.</p>
<p>That was before the news of a failed IUD. Before the plus sign. Before Jordan showed back up determined to make that night up to me.</p>
<p>I didn’t want a baby or a payday or a sexy, stubborn man in my life. I wanted to go back in time and pretend none of it had happened.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, my life had become all about that plus sign . . . and there wasn’t a damn thing I could do about it.</p>

<blockquote>I received this book for free from NetGalley in exchange for an honest review. This does not affect my opinion of the book or the content of my review.</blockquote>
<p>I’m not one much for the romance genre, even though it seems like I have quite a few in my NetGalley queue. But Bad Night Stand called to me because it seemed like it would be right up my alley.</p>
<p>I wasn’t wrong. I loved it. And in all honesty, I’m sincerely hoping that the author puts more of her books on NetGalley because I’m dying to read them all!</p>
<p>Abby and Jordan are great main characters. The development is great, even if you have to wait a bit to find out what makes them tick. You’ll probably hate Abby’s dad, which isn’t a surprise, but you’ll love Abby and Jordan. You’ll also come to love Seraphina, Bec, and Heather. And we can’t forget Hunter – he’s an absolute doll and you’ll love him as soon as he pops up in the book.</p>
<p>This story will tug your heart strings, make you laugh, and tick you off. There is some strong language in the book, which doesn’t bother me, but I thought I would mention it for those who might be bothered by strong language. There are also a few sex scenes for those who aren’t into that type of thing either.</p>
<p>This well written story is the first in a series and I am seriously chomping at the bit for the second book in the series after reading the epilogue. Trust me on this, you will be too!</p></article></li>
